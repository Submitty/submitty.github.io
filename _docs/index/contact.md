## Online Community Discussion

We have a public [Slack server for Submitty Developers](https://join.slack.com/t/submitty/shared_invite/enQtMzE1NzgyMzUzNzI5LWZhOGM4NWU4M2U3ZmM2ZmM5NTYwNjk3NTc5Yjg1ZGRlYzU1MjcwYWNkNGYxZjk2YTk3ZmEyODY3MjEyOTc0M2E).

Please use the Slack server `#general-welcome` and
`#gettingstarted-installation-development` and
`#technical-developers-studio` channels for community introductions,
to discuss Submitty installation problems, ask general development
questions, and have feature design discussion.  We appreciate the
Submitty community working together to help new developers.

When asking for help on installation, please include your host
operating system & version, and your versions of vagrant and virtual
box.  When asking for help on how to patch bugs or implement new features,
please describe what you've done to get started, what you've figured
out, and specifically where you're stuck.

_Special Request: Please do not contact administrator individuals by Slack
direct private message or personal email to ask technical questions.
It is likely that other developers have the same or similar questions
or are experiencing the same bug.  So we'd like to answer those questions
on the public forum.  And you'll probably get a faster reply when you
ask the larger community.  Thank you!_
