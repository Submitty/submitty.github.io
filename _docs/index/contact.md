* Please use the Zulip stream `#General-Welcome-Introductions` for
community introductions.

* Use the `#Installation/Getting Started`
stream to discuss Submitty installation problems and introductory
development questions.  When asking for help on installation, please
include your host operating system & version, and your versions of
vagrant and virtual box.

* The `#Submitty Developer Studio` stream is for more advanced
development questions and feature design discussion.  When asking for
help on how to patch bugs or implement new features, please describe
what you've done to get started, what you've figured out, and
specifically where you're stuck.

* If there is already a topic within the stream that is related to your
question, please use that.  Otherwise, please start a new topic.  We
appreciate the Submitty community working together to help new
developers.

* _Special Request: Please do not contact administrator individuals by
Zulip direct private message or personal email to ask technical
questions.  It is likely that other developers have the same or
similar questions or are experiencing the same bug.  So we'd like to
answer those questions on the public forum.  And you'll probably get a
faster reply when you ask the larger community.  Thank you!_
