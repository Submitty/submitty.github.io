1. Login to the homework server.  _NOTE: If you are a developer/admin,
   you will need to switch user to the instructor user for that
   specific course, e.g.: `sudo su smithj`_


2. Go to the top level directory for that course.  For example:

   ``` 
   cd /var/local/submitty/courses/f16/csci1200/ 
   ```

   _NOTE: If your course is cross-listed (e.g., 4000 level for
   undergraduates 6000 level for graduate students), you probably want
   to choose just one course number for the directory.  You can assign
   students to different registration sections to help organize the
   rainbow grades chart._


3.  Here is an overview of the course directory structure:

  
     ```

                         |               └── {parts (if multi-part)}[e.g."part1","part2",...]
                         |                   └── {student code, readme, timestamp}
                         ├── test_code

                         |       └── {instructor source code files used in assignment}

                                 └── {text files of expected outputs}
     ```
   

4. In your top level directory, you'll find a script named
   ```BUILD_csci1200.sh`` (with your course name instead of
   'csci1200').  To run this script, type:

   ```
   ./BUILD_csci1200.sh 
   ```

   This will rebuild the configurations for all gradeables.
   Alternatively, you may provide the names of one or more gradeables:

   ```
   ./BUILD_csci1200.sh hw01 hw05
   ```

   This script must be re-run each time you add or edit a
   Gradeable, or modify the assignment configuration details in
   corresponding ``config.json`` or the associated assignment files.

   If you are only using system-provided configurations (e.g.,
   no_autograding) or you are uploading configurations through the web
   interface, the script will re-run automatically.

   On the other hand, if you are writing custom configurations within
   a private repository (that is not accessible to the system
   ```submitty_daemon``` user, you will need to manually re-run this build
   script.

   For more details, please see: 
   [Assignment Configuration Details](assignment_configuration)

   NOTE: The script copies your homework configuration and testing
   files to the different subdirectories (```build```,
   ```test_code```, ```test_input```, ```test_output```, and
   ```config```), and compiles the ```config.h``` file with the core
   grading code located in
   [/usr/local/submitty/src/grading/](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/tree/master/grading)
   to produce executables (stored in the ```bin``` diretory) that will
   be used for grading each submission.  You should not manually edit
   any files in these directories because they will be overwritten the
   next time ```./BUILD_csci1200.sh``` is run.

5. When assignment submissions are received for this course, they are
   stored in the ``submissions`` directory (or the ``checkout``
   directory for SVN repository submissions).  All versions of all
   homeworks for all students are stored.  The file
   ``user_assignments_settings.json`` stores the current "ACTIVE"
   assignment, and this history of changes to the "ACTIVE" assignment
   made by the student.

   In a parallel directory hierarchy named ``results`` you can review
   the autograding results, and all associated log files (which are
   helpful for debugging).

   Finally, in the ``reports`` directory you can review text files with
   the TA grades and per student overall course grade summaries.
