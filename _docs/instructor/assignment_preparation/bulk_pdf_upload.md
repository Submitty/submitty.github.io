Submitty supports instructor upload of bulk PDF files to then be divided into individual assignment PDFs and assigned to students.

If there is TA grading, questions can also be assigned page numbers by either instructor or student. In the TA grading interface, clicking on a question will open the corresponding page in the PDF.



### Preparing the Exams for Scanning

* If you notice a student has extra pages or missing pages, or the
  exam is rather crumpled, set them to the side for individual
  scanning at the end.

* Scanning ~100-150 pages at a time works well, so for example if your
  exam is 14 pages (7 sheets of paper, front & back), separating the
  paper exams into stacks of 7-10 works well.

* Make most stacks the exact same count, and make sure the person
  working the scanner knows how many pages to expect per pack (e.g. 98
  pages or 140 pages).  The scanner person should check the page count
  after each scan and try to catch problems early.

* Use scissors to cut the staple corner off the exams.  *IMPORTANT:
  Carefully cut off the smallest amount of paper with the staple.  If
  you cut too much, the scanner feeder might fail to load the sheets
  of paper.*  Tap the exam papers on a table to align the sheets and
  make it less likely to jam or crumble in the feeder when scanning.

* Put a post-it note on the cover of the first exam of each page
  (remove the post-it for the actual scan), and give a letter/name to
  each exam pile.  Have that name match the scanned file name (either
  change the file name or write the scanner-generated name on the
  postit after scanning).  This will help tracking down the pile if it
  needs to be re-scanned because of stuck pages or scan quality
  settings.

* Optional: Re-staple the exams after scanning.  Note: This is less
  necessary if you've pre-printed exams with each students name on
  every page.


### Tips for Scanning

Explore the options / settings on your scanner.  Things to check:

* 150-300 dpi works well for most exams (300 dpi might be necessary
  for students with small cramped handwriting).

* Choose gray scale scanning (not black & white).

* You may want to adjust the brightness / contrast to be sure to pick
  up light handwriting.

* Choose duplex mode (double sided scanning).  Even if your exam is
  single sided, the students might write on the back.

* Specify "Do not rotate".  Some scanners will attempt to detect
  rotated pages and make errors rather than correct actual rotated pages.

* Make sure "Blank page removal" is not selected.  This will only
  throw off the page count!

* Choose a new directory to save your scans.  Scans should hopefully
  be sequentially numbered, or named with the timestamp to facilitate
  orderly upload to Submitty.




#### Scanning with the ScanSnap iX500 on Linux

We use the portable ScanSnap iX500 for scanning our exams. This works with
[SANE](http://www.sane-project.org/) out of the box; a variety of of
front-ends for SANE exist that work well with this
scanner. [Simple-scan](https://github.com/GNOME/simple-scan) works
fairly well - you will need to make sure to select the scanner in its
preferences and set it to scan 'Both' sides of each page; you can then
'scan all pages from feeder' and then export multiple exams into one
PDF, for bulk uploading.

Scanning with 150DPI with the photo setting generates reasonably sized
files - most PDFs generated are between 25 and 35MB for 140 pages.

Make sure you select 'Photo' from the Scan settings dropown in the top left corner:

![](/images/linux_scansnap_photo.png){:width="300px"}

And in the preferences menu, under Quality, select 150 dpi and adjust the brightness and contrast:

![](/images/linux_scansnap_150dpi.png){:width="500px"}

Check the quality and brightness/contrast of your initial scan.  The
background of white paper should scan light grey to ensure you pick up
light pencil marks and erased writing.  Make sure that the output
pixel values are true greyscale.  If your pixels are clamped to black
and white or clamped to a few shades of grey you will likely struggle
to read the full range of pencil markings.

Additionally, simple-scan dumps a lot of autosaved files into
`~/.cache/simple-scan/` (roughly 6.5GB of temporary files were
generated in one night, with about 650MB of outputted files). This
balloons pretty quickly and required clearing that out every few times
a PDF was exported.


### Creating the New Gradeable for Bulk PDF Upload

Click "New Gradeable" from the left sidebar and fill out the form.  Be
sure to select the Gradeable Type: "TA/Instructor will (bulk) upload
scanned .pdf for online manual grading".

![](/images/bulkupload_newgradeable.png){:width="600px"}

This gradeable is associated by default with the provided `pdf_exam`
configuration, which will allow you to upload batches of exams with
file size totaling up to 100 mb.

![](/images/bulkupload_autogradingconfig.png){:width="800px"}

_Note: You may need to ask your system admin to increase the
Ubuntu/Apache/php-fpm default upload limit for the server._

[Allow Large File Upload](/sysadmin/installation/system_customization#allowing-large-student-file-upload-submissions)


By default, the uploaded scanned pdf will be visible to students (and
downloadable) when the scores from manual grading are released.  You
can modify this setting from the "Submissions/Autograding" tab.



### Manual Rubric Preparation and Page Correspondence

You will presumably be grading this assignment manually -- by TA or
instructor.  If the assignment is formatted with problems on
specific pages, you can assign those pages as you prepare the manual
rubric.  Then, when the grader clicks to open a specific component of
the rubric, the students pdf file will be scrolled to that page.  

![](/images/bulkupload_assignedpages.png){:width="800px"}

Note: Alternately, if the student controls the layout of problems to pages
within the document, you can request that they specify the page
assignment when they upload the file.



### Bulk PDF Upload

On the gradeable submission page, the instructor has three options:
Normal Submission, Make Submission for a Student, and Bulk Upload. For
uploading bulk PDFs for exams/quizzes/assignments, select __Bulk
Upload__.


The default bulk upload does not expect a QR code on the cover page of
each exam.  Instead you will specify the length of each students exam
in number of pages, for example, 10 pages.  We'll expect each bulk
.pdf you upload to be a multiple of this number.

![](/images/bulkupload_submission.png){:width="500px"}

In the drag and drop box, upload the bulk exam PDF. You may submit
more than one PDF at once, but the box's maximum total size is 100Mb
(see note above about the Ubuntu/Apache/php-fpm limits).

Filenames should not contain characters such as (' , " , < , > , \ ) or spaces.

On submit, the bulk PDF is uploaded to the course's
`/uploads/bulk_pdf/gradeable_id` folder and the split PDF items to
`/uploads/split_pdf/gradeable_id` folder.

After the page reloads, another section on the page will appear called
"Unassigned PDF Uploads".




### Associating PDFs with Students in your Course

The "Unassigned PDF Uploads" section contains all items within the
`/uploads/split_pdf/gradeable_id` folder.

PDF preview contains the first page of the pdf. If you want to view
the full PDF, click on the popout icon.  To submit for a student,
enter their user ID and press enter or click submit. Autofill for user
ID brings up students who do not yet have any submissions for this
gradeable.

Once submitted, the split PDF item is moved from
`/uploads/split_pdf/gradeable_id` to its corresponding location in the
`/submissions/gradeable_id/user_id` folder.




### Automatic Association of PDFs using Customized Exams with QR Codes

Alternatively, if you have included a QR code on the coversheet of
every exam packet, the system can separate or split your large bulk
.pdf upload on the QR codes, and use the data from the QR code to help
associate the individual pdfs with students in your class.

![](/images/bulkupload_submission_qr.png){:width="500px"}

The system will decode the QR code to a string, e.g., `smithj`.  We
expect that string to be the user_id of a student in the course.

If the string contains a prefix and or a suffix in addition to the
user_id, you should specify those strings.  For example, you may
choose to use QR codes of the pattern `csci1000_smithj` and then would
specific `csci1000` as the prefix and leave the suffix blank.

If you are using a URL in your QR code, the prefix and suffix boxes
can remove URL components, for example
`https://myuniversity.edu/csci1000/student123/image.png` will result
in `student123` if the prefix is `https://myuniversity.edu/csci1000/`
and the suffix is `/image.png`.

*Note: the prefix substring must exactly match with a substring at the
 beginning of the QR string and the suffix must match a substring from
 the end, otherwise they will not be removed from the QR string.*

After processing, the `student_id` text area will be autofilled with
the string contained in the QR code along with a pagecount. Invalid
user ID's will be highlighted in pink.  Individual pdfs that do not
match the expected page count will be highlighted in red.

### Automatic Student ID Number Detection (*Work in progress!*)

*Note: This feature is currently [feature flagged](/developer/developing_the_php_site/feature_flags) the "submitty_ocr" flag must be set to true in your course config.json*

Instead of associating student IDs with QR codes you can provide 
a space for students to write their student ID number in. This 
will require placing a QR code to detect the region to scan.

*Note: QRs must be placed to the left of the digit entry box and must be taller than the box*

The QR code and digit entry box can be placed anywhere on the packet cover sheet and will be automatically located and scanned, currently you cannot have any other print to the right of the digit entry box.

To use this function select the 'Detect Student ID's' box on the 
submission page.
