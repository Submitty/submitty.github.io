### Instructor Navigation Page

The instructor navigation page is similar to the TA navigation page
(instructors can review or edit TA grades as needed).  However
instructors also have an "Edit" button for every gradeable in case the
release or due dates need to be changed, etc.  More info is available on the 
[Create / Edit Gradeable](/instructor/create_edit_gradeable) page.

### Course Management Menu Bar

Importantly, instructors also have a row of course configuration and
management options in the navigation bar to the left.  These are discussed more on the 
[Course Settings](/instructor/course_settings) page.
