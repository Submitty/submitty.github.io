title: Enabling Grade Inquiries
---

It is important for students to have the ability to understand why
they received a specific grade.  Grade Inquiries allow
graders and individual students to have a discussion on their work.


1. First, grade inquiries must be enabled for the course.  From the
   "Course Settings" page, under the "Grading" section, check the
   checkbox next to 'Grade Inquires Allowed'.

2. Second, grade inquiries must be enabled for each assignment, as
   desired. From the "Gradeables" page, click the pencil icon to edit
   the settings for a specific assignment.

3. From the "General" tab, make sure 'yes' is checked for
   'Will grade inquiries be enabled for this assignment?'

4. Finally, go to the "Dates" tab and set the 'Grade Inquiry Due Date'
   to a desired time in the future.

   Students must make the initial post to the grade inquiry system
   before that date.  Once the date passes, students and graders will
   be able to continue the conversation only for any unresolved grade
   inquiries.
