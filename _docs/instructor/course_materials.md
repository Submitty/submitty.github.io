Instructors have the option to post/host files on the Submitty server.
Access to these files (e.g., images, pdfs, provided code, input files)
will be restricted to students in the course who have logged in to
Submitty.  The instructor can also specify a release date for these
materials.  The Course Materials page is accessed via the "Course
Materials" label in the navigation bar.
