### Enabling the Office Hours Queue

To use the queue, an instructor level user for the course must first
enable this feature from the [Course Settings
page](/instructor/course_settings).

### Student Contact Information for Remote Assistance

If students will be connecting to the queue for remote office hours or
remote tutoring, the instructor user should also check the box to require
that students provide contact information.  The format of this contact
information is flexible.  You should inform your students of the
recommended procedure for receiving remote tutoring help.  You can do
this in the customizable "Welcome Message", and through other
communication and lecture materials.  For example, students might be
required to provide a phone number, email address, or remote meeting
URL.

If you have requested that students provide contact information to
allow remote office hours and remote tutoring, that information will
appear beneath each student's entry in the office hours queue.
