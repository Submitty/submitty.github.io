We will present a range of “case study” assignment configurations,
from simple through complex, using a variety of different automated
grading methods including per-character and per-line output difference
checkers, external unit testing frameworks (such as JUnit), memory
debugging tools (Valgrind and DrMemory), code coverage (e.g., Emma),
static analysis tools, and custom graders. Submitty can be customized
per test case as appropriate to apply resource limits (running time,
number of processes, output file size, etc.) and to display or hide
from students the program output, autograding results, and testing
logs.
