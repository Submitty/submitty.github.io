make_tree.js and make_tree_interactive.py are tools to visualize the json output from [commonAST](/instructor/commonAST) and [static analysis](/instructor/static_analysis) as trees.


### make_tree.js

```
node make_tree.js ./filename
```

This will output the tree in a .svg format. Make sure to include the ```./``` before ```filename``` in order for node.js to read the file.


### make_tree_interactive.py

```
python make_tree_interactive.py filename
```

This will output the tree in a .html format. Unlike make_tree.js, the trees produced by this tool are collapsible.

### Example Calls

```
node make_tree.js ./ex1a.json
```
Outputs an uninteractive .svg tree from the data of ex1a.json

```
python make_tree_interactive ex1a.json
```
Outputs an interactive .html tree from the data of ex1a.json
