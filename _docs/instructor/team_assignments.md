### Creating a Team Assignment

To create a team assignment, simply select “Yes” under the “Is this a
team assignment?” section when creating a gradeable.

_IMPORTANT NOTE: This option may only be specified when first creating
a new gradeable.  You may not edit an existing gradeable to switch it
from individual to team or from team to individual._

Selecting "Yes" will open a new option for maximum team size, which
refers to the maximum number of members that can join a team
(including the student who creates it).  _Note that instructors can
manage teams and override the maximum team size._


### Team Lock Date

Team gradeables have an additional options under the "Dates" tab to
set the team lock date, which will be the last date students can
create new teams or invite new members to existing teams.

### Creating And Editing Teams

Instructors also have the option of making teams for the students.

Once you've made the team assignment, click on the "Preview Grading"
button for that assignment.  You have 2 options:

* Prepare a common-separated values file (.csv) with 6 columns: First
  Name, Last Name, User ID, Team ID, Team Registration Section, and
  Team Rotating Section. The first row of the csv is assumed to be
  column headings and is ignored.

  Press the ```Import Teams Members``` button in the upper right and
  upload the .csv file.  Note: This option is only available if there
  are no teams for this gradeable.

* Press the pencil icon in the Edit Teams column for a student you'd
  like to put on a team to bring up the interface for editing a team

  * In the left "Team Member IDs" part, the grey blocks mean the
  existing members and the white blocks means the one you are going to
  add. You can use red "x" button to delete members. When adding 
  members, there will be a drop-down list to help you search.

  * Below is the "Team History" part. You can see the information of 
  editing and adding history.

Once at least one team has been formed, you will have the option to
```Export Teams Members``` to download a csv with the current teams,
which can then be imported into another team assignment.
