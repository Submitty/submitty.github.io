## Enabling the Discussion Forum

To enable the Discussion Forum for a course, an instructor user must
should select the "Course Settings" page from the left sidebar, and
then click the checkbox next to "Enable Discussion Forum".  This will
add the "Discussion Forum" page to the left sidebar for both students
and teaching staff.


## Features Available to Teaching Staff

The discussion forum comes with many features that enables effective
communication between students and the teaching staff.

* **Announcements**  
   Members of the Teaching Staff may specify that a new thread
   is an *announcement* that will be *pinned* to the top of the
   Discussion Forum thread list.  Announcements will be marked with a
   thumbtack to indicate their importance.

   Instructors can also choose to send the announcement as a Submitty
   system email to all members of the course, if [configured on the server](/sysadmin/email_configuration).

* **Post Edit History** users have the ability to edit their
   post. Members of the teaching staff have the ability to view each
   edit.

* **Statistics**  
   Members of the teaching staff can view forum posting history
   for each student in the course, with links to every post.  This feature
   is useful to award bonus points to students who engage on the forum and
   make impactful contributions to the course discussions.

*  **Merging Threads**  
   Often times students will ask the same question. Members of the teaching staff
   have the ability to merge similar threads. When merging a thread t1 into another thread t2,
   it is only possible to merge t1 into t2 if t2s last post occurred before t1 was created.

* **Alphabetic Post View Sorting**
   Members of the teaching staff may sort the posts alphabetically by
   student name to aid in grading.
