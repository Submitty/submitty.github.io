### Course Settings

From an instructor/head TA account, you can select "Course Settings"
and change the course name, and a few default settings for late days,
homework submission, VCS base URL, and TA grading. For the VCS base
URL, if you don't set it, it will default to the system-wide base URL
which is set by the sysadmin in configuring Submitty. Currently, only
Git is supported for VCS.
