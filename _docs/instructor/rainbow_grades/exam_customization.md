_NOTE: This is a work-in-progress._

Rainbow Grades Exam Seating works in coordination with the
[Room Templates](/instructor/room_templates) interface.


1. Add ``"exam_seating"`` to the ``"display"`` array in `customization.json` .

2. In the associative array (includes ``"id"``) for the gradeable you want seating
   for in ``"gradeables"``, add a new field ``"exam_data"`` which is associated with another
   associative array containing:

   * **field:** ``"active"``  
     **type:** _integer_  

     This should be set to `1` if this seating configuration is going to be used, and `0` otherwise.

   * **field:** ``"exam_title"``  
     **type:** _string_  

     This will be shown along with the ``"exam_date"`` and ``"exam_time"`` fields in the Rainbow Grades Custom
     Message shown to students on Submitty (if enabled).

   * **field:** ``"exam_date"``  
     **type:** _string_  

   * **field:** ``"exam_time"``  
     **type:** _string_  

   * **field:** ``"min_overall_for_zone_assignment"``  
     **type:** _float_  

     You can include this field to require that students have at least a certain overall score in the course
     in order to be assigned a seat. Otherwise, a zone will be assigned to each student who has an overall 
     grade of at least 0.1 and is in a valid section.

   * **field:** ``"exam_default_room"``  
     **type:** _string_  

     If a student is not assigned to a particular zone/seat, they will be assigned to this room with a
     zone of "SEE INSTRUCTOR".

   * **field:** ``"exam_seating_count"``  
     **type:** _string_  

     The name of the zone counts file described in the next steps.
     We'll use `exam1_zone_counts.txt` as an example.

   * **field:** ``"exam_seating"``  
     **type:** _string_  

     The name of the seating assignments file described in the next steps.
     We'll use ``exam1_seating.txt` as an example.

   An example of these fields in use is:

   ```
   "gradeables": [
   {
     "type": "exam",
     "count": 2,
     "ids":[
     {
       "id": "exam1",
       "max": 100,
       "exam_data": {
         "active": 1,
         "exam_title": "My CS Course Exam 1",
         "exam_date": "Wednesday May 10th",
         "exam_time": "3-5:50pm",
         "min_overall_for_zone_assignment": 40.5,
         "exam_default_room": "DCC 308",
         "exam_seating_count": "exam1_zone_counts.txt",
         "exam_seating": "exam1_seating.txt"
       }
     }
     ]
   }
   ]
   ```

3. Specify the number of seats you will have per zone in the
   `exam1_zone_counts.txt` file.  Each line of this file should
   be this format:

   ```
   <ZONE> <BUILDING> <ROOM> <#>
   ```

   Make sure you provide enough total seats across all zones for
   your students.


4. If you'd like to specify zone assignments, you may do so by
   preparing the file `exam1_seating.txt` file yourself.  The
   program will check that the assignment zones are valid and do
   not exceed the # of students per zone.  If you do not provide
   the seating file, students will be randomly assigned to zones.
   If you do not assign all of the students in valid sections to a
   zone, the remaining students will be assigned.  NOTE: This
   seating file is overwritten to add any unassigned students.

   The format of each line of the seating file is:
   
   ```
   <lastname>  <firstname>  <username>  <building>  <room>  <zone>  <time>
   ```
