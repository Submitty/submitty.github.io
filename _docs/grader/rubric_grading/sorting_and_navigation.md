## Sorting Options

![](/images/sorting_and_navigation/index.png)

On the grading index page there are several options available to sort students.  Many options allow for sorting
in ascending or descending order.  Select the option once for ascending order, press it a second time for descending.

**User ID:** Sort students alphabetically by their user ID.

**First Name:** Sort students alphabetically by their first name.

**Last Name:** Sort students alphabetically by their last name.

**Random:** Sort students in a pseudo-randomized order.  The random order is different for each gradeable.  The purpose
of this sorting order is to help distribute bias that comes along with always being graded first or last for each assignment.

## Prev / Next Student Buttons

These buttons allow the grader to move to the next submission.

**Limited access graders:** These buttons will only move to submissions within the grader's assigned sections.

**Full access graders:** These buttons can be used to browse submissions from all sections.

## Prev / Next Assigned Ungraded Student Buttons

These buttons allow the grader to move to the previous or next ungraded submission.
It is worth noting that these buttons will only move to ungraded submissions within a grader's assigned sections.

With no component open, selecting the next ungraded student button will move to the next submission with *any* component
ungraded.  This mode is useful when a grader is responsible for grading all components for a given submission. *(See image below)*

When a component is open, selecting the next ungraded student button will move to the next submission with
*that specific component* ungraded.  This mode is most useful when multiple graders are grading a single submission, each
working on different components. *(See image below)*
