## Overall Comment and PDF Annotations

In addition to the somewhat general-purpose system of common marks and points,
graders can leave more personalized type-written notes in the *Overall
Comment* box at the bottom of the grading rubric panel.

Additionally, the grader can add annotations to PDF documents that the
student has submitted.  These can be handwritten using a touchscreen
or digital tablet or typewritten textboxes placed on the document.

## PDF Automatic Scrolling

When grading a bulk-upload PDF submission, if there are page numbers assigned to the PDF and the rubric components then
going between the prev / next student while having the rubric and file panels open (with a rubric component with a page number assigned to it open) will automatically open the PDF and scroll it to the associated page number in the file panel.
