## Overall Comment and PDF Annotations

In addition to the somewhat general-purpose system of common marks and points,
graders can leave more personalized type-written notes in the *Overall
Comment* box at the bottom of the grading rubric panel.

Additionally, the grader can add annotations to PDF documents that the
student has submitted.  These can be handwritten using a touchscreen
or digital tablet or typewritten textboxes placed on the document.
