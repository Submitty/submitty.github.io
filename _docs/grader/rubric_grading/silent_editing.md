When grading a student's assignment, an instructor has the option of
making a silent edit to an already graded component.  This will change
the grade of the component without overriding the previous grader.

### How to Use Silent Edit

In the upper right conner of the rubric panel is a "Silent Edit"
checkbox. Also note that each component has been graded by the limited
access grader 'grader' (check the upper right conner of each
component).

As an instructor, changing the grade of any component will
automatically make you the grader of that component if "Silent Edit"
is not checked:

Note that the first component has now been graded by "instructor". If
"Silent Edit" is checked, the grader will not be overriden:

Note that the second component has still been graded by "grader", even
though the grade has been changed.
