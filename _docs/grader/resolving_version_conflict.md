title: Resolving a Version Conflict
---

## Overview of Issue

Typically, this issue occurs when the student changes the active version after the TA has started grading. Submitty supports multiple submissions before the due date. Any automated grading runs on each submission, and we store all submissions. Teaching staff can review each submission's version number and autograding results. After the deadline, manual/TA grading opens, and the TA/instructor grades the current active version. By default, the student's final version is active, but they can select a different version, even after the manual grading begins. This is where the version conflict results.


## Resolving the Version Conflict Manually

To clear this, in the grading interface, open & close each component that is labeled as being in conflict to confirm/update TA grading for the new version. The interface requires you to click each component of the rubric and either edit and save or just save. The current active version is stored for each component, so each will need to be confirmed. Once all of the messages are cleared, the student will be able to see your comments for the whole gradeable again. Alternatively, from the TA grading interface you can switch back to the version of the assignment that was initially marked for grading.
