### What is the Office Hours Queue?

In large courses with busy TA/instructor office hours or drop in
tutoring sessions, it is important to help students efficiently and
fairly, in a *first come, first served* manner.  Each course on
Submitty can enable one, or multiple, web-based help queues.

![](/images/queue/queue_main_view.png)

This web-based queue replaces a system that involved students writing
their name on a piece of paper or whiteboard or at the front of the
room.  The queue ensures fair access to course resources.  Students
cannot abuse the web-based queue by cutting in line or using a
pseudonym to write their name in the queue more than once.
Furthermore, it is particularly helpful for students with physical
disabilities or social anxieties that may want to avoid drawing
attention to themselves.

### When to use the Office Hours Queue

The office hours queue is ideal for situations where there is a
constant flow of students needing individualized help from one or more
TAs/instructors. The queue helps manage the students waiting to be
helped as well as the students currently being helped.  We store all
relevant timestamps for each entry in the queue.  Usage statistics can
be tracked, analyzed, and instructional resources balanced
appropriately.  *NOTE: Office Hours Queue Statistics coming soon!*


### Enabling the Office Hours Queue

To use the queue, an instructor level user for the course must first
enable this feature from the [Course Settings
page](/instructor/course_settings).

Once enabled, all students and TAs will see the "Office Hours Queue"
on the left sidebar of all course pages.

### Student Contact Information for Remote Assistance

If students will be connecting to the queue for remote office hours or
remote tutoring, the instructor user should also check the box to require
that students provide contact information.  The format of this contact
information is flexible.  You should inform your students of the
recommended procedure for receiving remote tutoring help.  You can do
this in the customizable "Welcome Message", and through other
communication and lecture materials.  For example, students might be
required to provide a phone number, email address, or remote meeting
URL.

If you have requested that students provide contact information to
allow remote office hours and remote tutoring, that information will
appear beneath each student's entry in the office hours queue.

### Creating a New Office Hours Queue

All users with limited access grader privileges or higher may access,
create, and manage office hours queues for this course.

To create and open a new queue you need click "Toggle Filter Settings"
button.  Then, enter a unique name for the new queue.  If your course
has multiple recitation or laboratory sections, you may want to make a
separate queue for each section/room.  You may also want to make
different queues for the type of assistance needed (e.g., help,
checkoff, code debugging, lecture material, etc.), as appropriate for
your topic and course structure.  *Note: A student may only join one
office hours queue at a time!*

![](/images/queue/queue_new_queue.png)

Often it is helpful to *require* that students be present in the
tutoring room prior to joining the queue.  To enforce this policy,
each queue has an access "code".  You can post this access code at the front
of the room, so only students in the room know the access code and can enter
the queue.  Then select "Open New Queue".

The access code of an existing queue can be changed or re-randomized
at any time by selecting the refresh icon to the right of the access code or
you may set your own access code, as desired.  Then press "Change Queue
Code".

### Managing an Existing Office Hours Queue

When the designated office hours or tutoring session is complete, the
TA/instructor should close the queue to prevent additional students
from joining the queue.  Click "Toggle Filter Settings" and then
"Close Queue" on the desired queue.  Closing the queue does not delete
it; rather, the uniquely named queue is available to be re-opened and
re-used tomorrow or next week!

All students who entered the queue before it was closed will remain in
the queue and can be helped.  Alternatively, the TA/instructor may
remove all students from the queue by pressing "Empty Queue" or press
"Delete Queue" to remove students from the queue *and* delete the
queue.


### Filtering Office Hours Queues

In a large course with multiple active/open queues and multiple
TAs/instructors helping students, it is typical to assign some
TAs/instructors to focus on specific queues.  Each TA/instructor can
filter the queue of all students waiting for help by clicking "Toggle
Filter Settings", and then selecting/filtering the list to one or more
queues.  Then press "Toggle Filter Settings" to close the queue names.

In the example above, only students in the *Section4* queue are
displayed.



### Helping Students in the Office Hours Queue

The queue is sorted chronologically by timestamp of student entry into the
queue.  Typically, the instructional staff will prioritize the queue
chronologically, helping the student at the top of the list.
To start helping a specific student in the queue, press the "Help"
button for that student.

![](/images/queue/queue_finish_green.png)

*NOTE*: Students who have not been helped yet this week (the last 5
days) *through this specific queue* will appear with a *star* next to
the blue "Help" button.  If a student has not been helped yet today,
but has been helped in the last 5 days a *half star* will be
displayed.  In the example above, Hazel and Alyssa have not yet been
helped this week (at least not through the Section4 queue), but Ben
has already been helped at least once today.  To fairly distribute
tutoring resources, the instructional staff may adopt a policy whereby
*starred* and/or *half starred* students are prioritized, even if they are
not the student who has been in the queue the longest.

Once you have started helping a student, the status button for that
student will switch to a green "Finish Helping" button.  Also the
"Time" column will switch from the wall clock time when the student
entered the queue, to a minutes and seconds timer (m:ss) indicating
the length of time that you have been helping that student.  This
information will be helpful in busy office hours with limited
instructional staff.  The TAs/instructors may set a policy with a
maximum time limit for help/tutoring per student.

![](/images/queue/queue_finish_blue.png)

*Note:* If there are multiple TAs/instructors staffing the office
hours queue, your display will show a blue "Finish Helping" button
for students being helped by other TAs/instructors.

When you have finished helping a student, press the "Finish Helping"
button.  If you forget to click this button to remove the
student from the queue, they can exit the queue from their own
interface.




### Note about Student Privacy

When students join the queue, they may specify an alternate name --
different from both their legal/registration name and their
[preferred name](/student#how-can-i-change-my-preferred-name).
The queue name is the name that the TA/instructor will call out aloud
in the room, if they do not know
the each students by name/face.  The TA/Instructor also has access to view the
student's user id by clicking the eye icon.


### Office Hours Queue History

The bottom of the page shows the most recent events in the queue from
the current day.  As desired, you can click to view all queue events
from the current day.  The history displays who was helped, how long
they waited before help arrive, the length of time they were being
helped, and who helped them.  The history includes an option to the
student to the queue if they were accidently removed.
