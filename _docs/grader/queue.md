### Overview of the Queue
A new way to organize, assist, and empower students to get the help they need.

"help" button.

### What is the Queue

The queue available on submitty allows each class to maintain
multiple queues per class. This makes it easier for students
to get help from a member of the teaching staff without having
to move to the board and write your name on a central board or 
draw attention to yourself.

### Who does the Queue help
The queue is meant to be used by anyone. However, this feature
is particularly helpful for physically handicapped students who
may find moving to write their name on the board a difficult task.
In addition students with social anxieties may be less likely to 
want to draw attention to themself but the queue allows them to get
help without the extra attention that comes from raising your hand.

### When to use the Queue
The queue is ideal for any situation where there is a constant flow 
of students needing help from instructors. The queue helps manage the
students waiting to be helped as well as the students currently being 
helped and keeps track of previously helped students.

### Enabling the Queue

In order to use the queue, the primary instructor for the course
needs to enable the features inside of course setting. Once enabled you
should have a new option on the left side of the screen.

### Opening new Queue

In order to open a new queue you need to toggle the filter settings.
From here enter a unique name which can be used to identify your
queue. Then for an added layer of security generate a code to prevent
people who do not know the code from entering the queue. This code can
be random by selecting the refresh icon to the right of the code or 
enter your own. Then select open queue.

### Managing a Queue
The queue is designed so it can stay available for the duration of the class.
While the settings does give you the option to delete the queue and open a new
one, opening and closing a queue is the preferred method. In addition you have
the ability to clear out all students in the queue by selecting empty queue.

It is possible that multiple queues will be open at the same time but you are only
intrested in viewing a subset of those queues. You can filter which queues you have
access to by checking the box next to the desiered queues.

Sometimes it may be necessary to change the code for an existing queue. this can be done
without clearing out the existing students in the queue by selecting a queue and creating 
new code under settings.

### Helping Students in the Queue
In order to start helping students in the queue, use the "help" button.
Once selected that button will appear green on your device with the text
"Finish Helping" as well as start a timer so you can easily track how long
that student has been getting help. If their are multiple instructor the 
others will also be able to see a student is being helped and for how long
however, the status button only appear green to the instructor who started
helping the student. Students should be removed from the by using "Finish Helping"
button. However, if a student needs to be removed from the queue and was never helped
this can be down with the "Remove" button.

### Protecting Privacy with the Queue
When students join the queue they may not be comfortable using their real name
and have the option of entering something different. However, if students abuse this
privilage instructors have the ability to view the students username used for login by
selecting the eye icon.

### Queue History
The queue history shows that the backlog of students from that day. By default the history 
only shows the most recent activity but the enitre backlog is available to view. The history
keeps track of who was helped, how long they waited and were helped for, who helped them. As
well as the option to restore their place in the queue if they were accidently removed.
