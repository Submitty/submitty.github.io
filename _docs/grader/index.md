### TA Navigation Page

When a TA or Grader user logs into the course, they have access to the
same submissions links as the student (left column of colored
buttons).  But in addition, they have an additional column of buttons
to the right, to review the student submissions and enter grades for
each assignment.

### TA Grading Complements Automated Grading

After selecting an assignment, the TA is presented with an overview of
their assigned grading for this assignment.  

The TA can then click to see an index page of all students in their
assigned sections:

Students who have not yet been assigned a TA grade have blue
"Grade" buttons under the "TA Grading" column.

Clicking on one of the "Grade" buttons brings up the multi-pane TA
grading interface.  The 4 panes are:

* Automated Test Case Results (red border)

* File and Directory Browser (blue border) - displays the tree
  hierachy of files and directories.  The grader can expand to view
  any of the files, or "pop out" a browser window to view a single
  file.

* Grading Rubric (green border) - divided into one or more components specified

* Student Information (black border)

After completing the grading of this student and pressing "Submit" the
TA returns to the index page and the "Grade" button for that student
is replaced with a white button and the student's TA score for that
assignment.

### TA Grading of Non-Electronic Assignments

Submitty can also be used to record grades for items that are not
strictly electronic uploads of files.

Submitty provides a spreadsheet-like interface for the data entry of
numeric gradeables (e.g. Quizzes or Tests).  The instructor specifies
the number of problems, and the maximum score for each problem.  The
total score for each student is summed automatically.

If the assignment is scored less precisely, the instructor can use the
checkpoint interface.  The TA clicks once to give the student full
credit (dark blue), or the TA clicks twice to give the student half
credit (light blue).  A triple click returns the box to zero credit (white).
