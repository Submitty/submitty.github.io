When a TA or Grader user logs into the course, they have access to the
same submissions links as the student (left column of colored
buttons).  But in addition, they have an additional column of buttons
to the right, to review the student submissions and enter grades for
each assignment.

Make sure to also checkout these links to get a better understanding of the program features.

[Checkpoint Grading](/grader/checkpoint_grading),
[Numeric / Text Grading](/grader/numeric_text_grading), and
[Rubric Grading](/grader/rubric_grading).
