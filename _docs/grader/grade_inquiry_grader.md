### Submitting a Grade Inquiry for a Student

A grader can also open a grade inquiry for a student by navigating to
the TA Grading Interface and finding the regrade panel and pressing
the blue 'Submit Grade Inquiry' button.  This option is useful when a
student initiates a grader inquiry or regrade request via email or in
person during office hours.
