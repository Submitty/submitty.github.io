The *Numeric / Text Grading* interface is appropriate for recording
grades via a spreadsheet-like interface with one or more columns of
numbers, which are summed automatically.

Each column has a maximum value and can also be configured as an extra
credit column.  The form also supports columns for text that can be
useful for recording simple explanatory grading notes that are visible
to students via [Rainbow Grades](/instructor/rainbow_grades).

The numerical data can also be uploaded to Submitty via a CSV (Comma
separated value) file upload.

[Rubric Grading](rubric_grading).
