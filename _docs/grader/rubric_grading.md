An important *complement to automated grading* is detailed rubric
grading by the TA or instructor.  After selecting an assignment, the
TA is presented with an overview of their assigned grading for this
gradeable.  The initial landing page presents statistics about the
number of student submission, completed grading, and average scores
for autograding and manual grading.

To start grading, press the blue "Grading Index" button.  Students
with incomplete grading will have a blue "Grade" button.

Clicking on one of the "Grade" buttons brings up the multi-pane TA
grading interface.  The 4 panes are:

* Automated Test Case Results (red border)

* File and Directory Browser (blue border) - displays the tree
  hierachy of files and directories.  The grader can expand to view
  any of the files, or "pop out" a browser window to view a single
  file.

* Grading Rubric (green border) - divided into one or more components specified

* Student Information (black border)

Once rubric grading is completed for a student, the blue "Grade"
button is replaced with a white button with student's TA score.
