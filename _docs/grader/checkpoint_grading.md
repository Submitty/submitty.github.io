The *Checkpoint Grading* interface is appropriate for simple,
low-precision grading -- for example for attendance of completion of
laboratory modules.

The TA clicks once to give the student full credit (dark blue), or the
TA clicks twice to give the student half credit (light blue).  A
triple click returns the box to zero credit (white).

Instructors and Full Access Graders can view the timestamp and grader
for each awarded checkpoint.

[Rubric Grading](rubric_grading).
