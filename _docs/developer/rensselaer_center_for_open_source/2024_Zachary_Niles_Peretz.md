While I completed tasks across Submitty, I primarily focused on expanding the Rainbow Grades GUI Customization Menu so that it would become more widely used by professors. I implemented several features to the menu so that it could match the capabilities of manual JSON configuration, improved the user interface experience, added testing, and fixed bugs.

My work includes, but is not limited to, the following items:

## Rainbow Grades Web-Based Customization
#### Features Implemented
 - Adjusting final grade cutoffs (PR [#10518](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/10518))

 - Grading assignments by configurable percents instead of by score (PR [#10763](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/10763))
