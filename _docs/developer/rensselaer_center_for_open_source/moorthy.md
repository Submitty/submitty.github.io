[Professor Mukkai Krishnamoorthy](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/),
affectionately known as Moorthy, is the heart and soul of the
[Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS)](https://rcos.io/), of which
he served as director from 2007-2018.  With Moorthy's support and
encouragement, membership in RCOS grew from a couple dozen students
per year to well over 100 students per term -- and somehow he still
knew everyone's name and technology for each project!  Moorthy
emphasizes students' freedom to explore and learn and create.

Thus, in honor of our beloved faculty member, Professor
Krishnamoorthy, we name the Submitty [duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) mascot "Moorthy".
