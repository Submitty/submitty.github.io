### Summary

Over the ten weeks, I was a key contributor to the large-scale, open-source academic platform, where my work focused on developing major features, modernizing infrastructure, enhancing security, and improving the user interface and experience. I authored or contributed to 24 pull requests, reviewed 82 pull requests, and created 6 issues, many of which were resolved or are part of ongoing efforts such as end-to-end testing of notifications and rate limiting. These contributions spanned the entire technology stack, including the frontend (HTML/CSS, JS/TS, Twig, Vue.js), backend (PHP), build systems (Bash), autograding infrastructure (Python, C++), and system testing (Cypress).
