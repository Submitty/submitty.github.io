## Preliminary Design Notes

* *blue buttons*: say "please click me", this is an action you should
   take.  Examples: Click here to form a team.  Click here to submit
   your homework.  Click here to participate in the discussion form.
   Click here to see your semester grades.

* *red buttons*: indicate "youâ€™re in trouble", something is overdue.
   Examples: The homework deadline has passed and you did not submit
   or you have a low grade on your submission.  You have missed the
   deadline for completing your assigned grading.

* *green buttons*: let the student know something new is available.
   Example: The homework grades have been released and you have not
   yet viewed the detailed grade.

* *white/grey buttons*: are infrequently-used optional actions.
   Examples: Cancel an assignment submission.  Request a TA regrade.


An example is the design for the navigation page
