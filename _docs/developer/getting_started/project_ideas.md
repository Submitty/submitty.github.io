1. **Expand Testing of the Manual/TA Rubric Grading Interface**

   [Overview of Rubric Grading Interface](/grader/rubric_grading/index)

   Our TA grading interface is elaborate, highly-featured, and
   customizable.  However, the interface is visually overwhelming to
   new graders and some of our TA grading features are not adequately
   tested by automated unit and end-to-end (Cypress) regression testing.

   [Open Issues related to TA Grading](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22TA+Grading+%2F+TA+UI%22)  
   [Open Issues related to Sample Data](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Sample+Data%22)

   _Expected Outcomes_: The primary goals for this project include the
   expansion of our automated testing of the TA Grading pages and to
   patch bugs uncovered by this improved testing.  The project may be
   expanded in scope to additionally propose and execute small or
   modest user interface revisions that enhance the TA experience,
   especially for graders who are new to the interface and grading
   process.
   
   _Skills & Experience Required_: Some programming experience,
   willingness to learn web and database development and the Cypress
   end-to-end automated testing framework.  Having served as a
   teaching assistant with grading experience design will be
   beneficial.

   _Possible Mentors_: William Allen, Nia Heermance, Barb Cutler

   _GSoC Project Size_: 90 or 175 hours

   _Difficulty Level_: introductory to medium

2. **Refactor and Performance Improvements for the Manual/TA Rubric Grading Interface**

   [Overview of Rubric Grading Interface](/grader/rubric_grading/index)

   _Note: This project may be combined with the previous project idea._

   The Manual/TA rubric grading interface is elaborate,
   highly-featured, and customizable; however, the performance of
   these webpages is problematic for large courses due to inefficient
   database queries and server communication delays to load data that
   could/should be asynchronous.  The manual/TA rubric pages could
   benefit from a significant technology refactor to use Vue/Vite, for
   example.

   [Open Issues related to TA Grading](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22TA+Grading+%2F+TA+UI%22)

   _Expected Outcomes_: This project would first prepare a detailed
   software design plan for an organized, multi-stage incremental
   refactor of the manual/TA rubric pages and follow with the
   execution/implementation of a significant portion of the new
   design.  The project could include the extension and/or updating of
   our automated end-to-end (Cypress) testing and patching bugs
   uncovered by this testing (as described in the previous project
   idea).  The project should include benchmarking along the way to
   ensure that the refactor is improving the performance of the
   Manual/TA Rubric Grading interface. The general interface for
   TA/Manual grading should remain similar, but the project may
   include small user interface revisions.

   _Skills & Experience Required_: Web and database development
   experience and general software design and implementation
   experience.  Experience with end-to-end automated testing (Cypress)
   and and having served as a teaching assistant with grading
   experience design is beneficial but not required.

   _Possible Mentors_: Nia Heermance, William Allen, Barb Cutler

   _GSoC Project Size_: 175 or 350 hours

   _Difficulty Level_: medium to challenging

3. **Notebook Builder: UI To Streamline Instructor Configuration of Automated Grading**

   Our system for automated testing and grading of student work is
   very powerful, but the configuration process that instructors must
   navigate is complex and time-consuming.  While we provide a number
   of examples, the number of choices for development of an
   autograding configuration is overwhelming.  The primary method for
   creating an autograding configuration is to prepare a `config.json`
   file (and any necessary additional files) and upload or store these
   files on the server file system.  We have a prototype Web GUI
   interface we call the "Notebook Builder" but the current state of
   the feature is undocumented and functionality is limited.  We
   would like to improve and expand this feature to facilitate
   instructor creation of basic and moderate complexity autograding
   configurations.

   [Assignment Autograding Configuration Instructions](/instructor/autograding/specification)  
   [Notebook Assignment Configuration](/instructor/assignment_configuration/notebook)  
   [Tutorial Autograding Configuration Examples](https://github.com/Submitty/Tutorial/tree/main/examples)

   This project will involve multiple modules of Submitty including
   web UI development, integration, documentation, additional tutorial
   examples, and extending output generation to instructor solutions
   in compiled languages.

   [Open Issues related to Autograding](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/labels/Autograding)  
   [Open Issues related to Notebook / Notebook Builder](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Notebook+%2F+Notebook+Builder%22)

   _Expected Outcomes_: The primary focus of the project is the
   revision and expansion of the Notebook Builder UI to increase the
   number of autograding features that are supported.  The UI should
   be easy-to-use for instructors of
   non-computer-science/non-programming courses and also instructors of courses with
   introductory to moderate programming assignments.  The size and
   scope for a proposal in this area is flexible, depending on the
   time commitment and prior skills of the applicant.
      
   _Skills & Experience Required_: Some programming experience,
   willingness to learn web and database development.  Prior
   experience with user interface design and an eye for quality user
   design are beneficial.  Having served as a teaching assistant or
   instructor with experience in programming assignment design will be
   beneficial but not required.

   _Possible Mentors_: Barb Cutler, Chris Reed

   _GSoC Project Size_: 90 or 175 or 350 hours

   _Difficulty Level_: introductory or medium

4. **Expansion of Examples and Documentation of Intermediate and Advanced Autograding Features**

   _Note: This project is related to previous project idea but is a distinct project._

   Our system for automated testing and automated grading of student
   work is very powerful and highly-customizable, but the
   documentation for our moderate and advanced autograding features is
   incomplete.  While we provide a number of autograding examples,
   some of the examples are out-of-date and do not represent our
   current suggested best practices.

   [Assignment Autograding Configuration Instructions](/instructor/autograding/specification)  
   [Submitty Autograding Tutorial Examples](https://github.com/Submitty/Tutorial)  
   [Additional Autograding Examples](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/tree/master/more_autograding_examples)  
   [Prior GSoC Project: Drumil Patel](/developer/google_summer_of_code/2019_DrumilPatel)  
   
   We would like to reduce the learning curve for new instructors and
   provide more tutorial examples of autograding for instructors
   teaching courses of any level.  Automated testing and automated
   grading can be used in introductory programming courses in middle
   and high schools, including AP Computer Science.  It can also be
   used by programming-intensive intermediate and upper level / senior
   university-level systems coursework.  Assignments that require can
   be configured with custom Docker Images to provide access to
   specific programming languages and libraries. 

   [Open Issues related to Docker Image Autograding](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues?q=label%3A%22Docker+Container+Autograding%22+)  
   [Docker Images for Autograding Common Programming Languages](https://github.com/Submitty/DockerImages/tree/main)  
   [Example Custom Docker Images University ](https://github.com/Submitty/DockerImagesRPI/tree/main/dockerfiles)  
   [Sample Java Assignments](/instructor/autograding/sample_assignments)

   _Expected Outcomes_: The project should begin with a review and
   organization of existing sample and tutorial assignments and
   current autograding functionality documentation.  Out-of-date or
   underdeveloped autograding configuration examples should be
   expanded as necessary, and features that are missing documentation
   and examples should be identified (e.g., generated random input and
   output from instructor solution, customized docker containers,
   autograding graphical output, autograding) and resolved by creating
   new examples.  Finally, we would like to create and support a
   resource for the community of crowd-sourced complete programming
   assignments/exercises with included autograding configuration.

   _Skills & Experience Required_: Moderate to advanced programming
   experience, willingness to learn web and database development.
   Having served as a teaching assistant or instructor with experience
   in programming assignment design will be beneficial.

   _Possible Mentors_: Chris Reed, Barb Cutler

   _GSoC Project Size_: 175 or 350 hours

   _Difficulty Level_: medium to challenging

5. **AI/ML to Enhance and Steamline Manual / TA Grading**

   The use of a unified and retroactively editable rubric for
   manual/TA grading can ensure consistency when grading large
   courses, especially when more than one grader is working on a
   single problem or assignment.  However, it is usually still
   necessary for the graders to inspect the student work one-at-a-time
   and it can be difficult for the grader to remember the details of
   all previously graded assignments and recognize patterns that
   should be graded similarly.  Furthermore, the process of manual
   grading is time-consuming and thus detailed and thoughtful
   constructive feedback to each individual is often not possible.

   [Overview of Rubric Grading Interface](/grader/rubric_grading/index)

   The goal of this project is to explore the potential to leverage
   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to reduce the burden
   of manual grading in large courses with either programming or
   non-programming assignments.  Automatically organizing student
   submissions into groups that contain similar patterns and have
   common strengths or flaws can ensure that student work is assessed
   consistently and students receive appropriate and in-depth
   feedback to aid their learning.

   The Submitty project includes related technology for the static
   analysis of student's code and tools to screen for plagiarism in
   both student-submitted plain text assignments and software.  Note
   that the Submitty static analysis and plagiarism tools have been
   tested and validated with datasets of sample student submissions;
   however, for privacy and confidentiality reasons, these datasets are
   not and cannot be part of the Submitty open-source materials.

   [Autograding using Static Analysis](/instructor/autograding/static_analysis/index)  
   [Plagiarism Detection](/instructor/course_management/plagiarism)

   _Expected Outcomes_: Detailed design plan for the integration of an
   AI/ML framework into Submitty for the analysis and clustering the
   assignment submissions by students based on common patterns in the
   text and/or code.  Implementation of a prototype AI/ML tool to
   detect common patterns in student submissions and present this
   information to the grader in an organized way to allow streamlined
   bulk grading and feedback within the manual/TA grading interface.
   As time permits (and based on the scope and time commitment)
   evaluation of the effectiveness of this technique on real world
   data and the potential for improving the efficiency of the
   manual/TA grading process and the quality/accuracy and quantity of
   useful constructive feedback to students.
   
   _Skills & Experience Required_: Coursework and/or professional
   experience in AI/ML and modern AI/ML technology.  Moderate to
   advanced programming experience, and willingness to learn web and
   database development.  Having served as a teaching assistant for a
   large course with manual grading experience design will be
   beneficial.
   
   _Possible Mentors_: Barb Cutler, William Allen, Nia Heermance

   _GSoC Project Size_: 175 or 350 hours

   _Difficulty Level_:  medium to challenging
