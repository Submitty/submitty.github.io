If you want to update or add documentation to Submitty.org here's what you do:

1. If you haven't already, you'll need to clone the git repo of 
    Submitty.org:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Submitty/submitty.github.io.git
    ```

2. After cloning the repo, go into the `_docs` folder. You will see a folder
    representing each major category on Submitty.org

3. Navigate to whichever page you want to edit and open it in your text editor of choice. 
    The files are written in Markdown.

4. Run Jekyll locally to generate and view the webpages and proofread your edits:
    [README.md](https://github.com/Submitty/submitty.github.io/blob/main/README.md)

5. After you are done editing, you can submit a pull request for review.
