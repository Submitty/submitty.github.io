__Minimum Version__: 3.8

For Python, we use [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
to check Python code such that it follows things laid out in [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), 
[PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), etc. The code is linted as part of our automated Travis-CI
testsuite to ensure compliance. To locally lint the code, you will need to install four modules:
```bash
pip3 install flake8 flake8-bugbear pylint
```
and then you can just run `flake8` at the root to check all files or pass it an individual file to check just that.
To see all files that are currently checked as part of Travis-CI, please look at the `.flake8` config file.

For pylint, you can just run `pylint --recursive=y .` at the root to check all files or pass it an individual file.
