To ensure that the Submitty Org Admins and Mentors have all of the
information about your ideas, project plan, and availability for
Google Summer of Code 2026, we ask you to use the Submitty Applicant
Template.




The template will include:

* Your skills, relevant coursework, non-course experience, and future
  career goals that qualify you to work on this project.

* Approximate schedule for the summer: start date, end date, and
  number of hours of work per week.

* Description of any classes, employment, or other time commitments
  during that time period.

* Engagement with the Submitty project team during the application
  period.  This includes participation in public discussions on our
  [Zulip server](/contact): asking technical questions about issues
  and work-in-progress PRs, helping other prospective applicants with
  installation hiccups and development problems, etc.

* Links to all GitHub pull requests to the Submitty organization and
  their current status (submitted, reviewed, revised, approved,
  merged).  _NOTE: significant/large pull requests take more time to
  review for completeness and correctness.  It's ok if your work is
  not merged before the GSoC application deadline._

* Links to all Submitty PRs authored by other developers that you have
  reviewed.  _NOTE: reviews should be thoughtful and substantive with
  specific details about how the code was manually tested and whether
  any improvements to the code for readability/maintainability are
  suggested.  PR reviews that simply comment "LGTM" are not as
  helpful._
