   Please use the "Google Summer of Code 2026" channel to introduce yourself, engage with other
   prospective GSoC Applicants, ask technical questions, and help review and assist other
   developers as they also become familiar with the Submitty code base and development process.

   Ask specific technical questions about the Submitty system and open
   issues and help answer technical questions from other new developers if
   you think you can help.  Your engagement in the community discussion
   during the application period (both asking and answering questions) will 
   be taken into account as we evaluate your application.

   __NOTE: The Submitty mentors for Google Summer of Code are on our
   Zulip server.  Please communicate through the public channels/streams and
   do not direct message (DM) / private message any mentors. 
   Mentors will generally not respond to private messages.__

6. New developers should start with an issue labeled "Good First Issue".
   To understand the existing functionality/bug, reproduce and test this feature on your development VM.
   Inspect the relevant system files and database contents.
   Carefully read through all messages posted under the issue, and read through
   other issues or pull requests that are linked to the issue.
   New developers can also get up to speed by reviewing and testing the pull requests
   of other developers that aim to solve and close issues labeled "Good First Issue".

   NOTE:  More recent issues in the Submitty Github database tagged "Awaiting Triage"
   have not yet been reviewed by the Submitty Project administrators.
   These details of these bug reports and feature requests may need editing and revision
   to confirm they meet with the long-term needs and goals of the Submitty project.
   Before starting to work on one of these issues, we recommend you check with the
   project team by creating a new discussion thread about the issue on our [Zulip server](/contact).

7. Submit a pull request to solve an open issue.

    The template will also ask for your approximate schedule for the
    summer: start date, end date, and number of hours of work per week.
    And a description of any classes, employment, or other time
    commitments during that time period.  

    Most importantly, you will summarize your engagement with the
    Submitty project team during the application period.  This includes
    participation in public discussions on our [Zulip server](/contact),
    authoring of new pull requests (both in progress and merged), and
