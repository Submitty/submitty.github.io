# Peer Grading 
Peer grading feature establishes the concept of students grading other students which was aimed to increase the quantity and diversity of detailed feedback on student assignments and presentations along with facilitating students to see other ways of approaching a problem, and asking important questions about the effectiveness of those alternate methods.

# About 
My Name is [Harsh Joshi](https://linkedin.com/in/josharsh). I am a computer science undergradute from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies.
The project was under the mentorship of [Barbara Cutler](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/), [Evan Maicus](https://github.com/emaicus) and [John Hulton](https://github.com/jchulton).

# Contributions

## Randomized Peer Assignments 
Randomized assignments of peer graders in a class was an upgrade from manual csv upload of the peer grading matrix. This feature enables using GUI interface to prepare a random assignment where each student grades *n* random students (and also receives feedback from *n* random students).

## Bug Fix on Grading Index Stats
Upgraded grading index to take peer grading statistics for calculation of Manual Grading total. Fixed bugs involving maximum total for manual grading score and final score.

## Stoplights Upgrade
The white, green, yellow, blue, and purple stoplights indicate grading progress per submission. My work included restricting peer graders from accessing non peer stoplights and upgrading stoplights for gradeables with both peer and non peer components.

## Grading Statistics 
The grading stats on the status page show relevant grading figures including number of students who submitted, number of assignments which have been graded, grading stats by registration, and data on average scores etc. My work included to upgrade grading figures for peer gradeables with access to peer grading stats on student and non student views, and fix bugs on incorrect grading data for gradeables with mix of peer and non peer components.
