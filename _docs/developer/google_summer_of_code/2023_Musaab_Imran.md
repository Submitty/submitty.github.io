## 🛡️ Website Security and Penetration Testing
The security of the Submitty website is of paramount importance due to its direct impact on student grades and academic integrity. Even a single vulnerability can lead to unfair academic advantages and legal complications concerning student data protection. Therefore, this project aimed to contribute to the assurance of proper access control, authorization mechanisms, and robust code that align with the high security standards expected from educational platforms like Submitty.

## 🔐 Security PRs
This section contains pull requests related to security enhancements, fixes, and updates.

#### Cache Control
Implemented Cache-Control header to ensure proper resource caching behavior. This prevents intermediaries from caching the resource, reducing the risk of serving outdated content.

🔺[PR #9693](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/9693)

#### Content Type Options
Content-Type-Options header stops pages from loading during content-sniffing attacks, significantly reducing security risks by preventing incorrect MIME type interpretation.

🔺[PR #9694](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/9694)

#### Content Security Policy
Implemented Content-Security-Policy header which prevents external iframe embedding, bolstering security by mitigating clickjacking threats.

🔺[PR #9695](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/9695)


#### Adding CORS Security Headers
Implemented CORS security headers to prevent cross-origin attacks, enhancing web security by preventing potentially unsafe cross-origin interactions, safeguarding against credential leakage and minimizing data exposure risks.

🔺[PR #9771](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/9771)


#### Referrer Policy Header 
Implemented Referrer-Policy header to prevent the leakage of sensitive information, reducing the risk of information disclosure attacks.

🔺[PR #9772](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/9772)


#### Updating Disabled Functions List 
Updated the list of disabled functions to prevent the execution of potentially dangerous PHP functions. This reduces the risk of remote code execution and other malicious attacks.

🔺[PR ]()

#### Whitelisting MIME Types
Whitelisted MIME types to prevent the execution of potentially dangerous file types. This reduces the risk of remote code execution and other malicious attacks. Only the allowed MIME types can be uploaded to the server.
