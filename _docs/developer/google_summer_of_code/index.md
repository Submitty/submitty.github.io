   in a virtual machine on your computer.

4. Review our project ideas list:   
   [https://submitty.org/developer/getting_started/project_ideas](/developer/getting_started/project_ideas)

5. Join our Zulip server to ask questions and meet other new developers:   
   [https://submitty.org/contact](/contact)
   
   Ask specific technical questions about the Submitty system and open
   issues and help answer technical questions from other new developers if
   you think you can help.  Your engagement in the community discussion
   during the application period (both asking and answering questions) will 
   be taken into account as we evaluate your application.

   _NOTE: The Submitty mentors for Google Summer of Code are on our
   Zulip server.  Please communicate through the public streams and
   do not direct message (DM) / private message any mentors. 
   Mentors will generally not respond to private messages._

6. Search the Submitty Github for related open issues (bugs and feature requests):   
   [https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/issues)

   New developers should start with an issue labeled "Good First
   Issue". To understand the existing functionality/bug, reproduce and
   test this feature on your development VM. Inspect the relevant
   system files and database contents.

   _NOTE:  More recent issues in the Submitty Github database tagged "Awaiting Triage"
   have not yet been reviewed by the Submitty Project administrators.
   These details of these bug reports and feature requests may need editing and revision
   to confirm they meet with the long-term needs and goals of the Submitty project.
   Before starting to work on one of these issues, we recommend you check with the
   project team by creating a new discussion thread about the issue on our [Zulip server](/contact)._

7. Submit a pull request to solve an open issue.  
   [https://submitty.org/developer/getting_started/make_a_pull_request](/developer/getting_started/make_a_pull_request)
   
8. Help test and review [open pull requests](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pulls) contributed by other developers.
   [https://submitty.org/developer/getting_started/review_a_pull_request](/developer/getting_started/review_a_pull_request)

   NOTE: We always have a large number of _work-in-progress_ pull
   requests from both new and experienced developers.  Prospective
   developers with any level of experience are welcome and needed to
   help review these PRs.  Contributing to the review process is
   beneficial to everyone.

9. Begin work on your GSoC Project application. We recommend
    prospective contributors focus on one of our suggested projects
    from the [project ideas](/developer/getting_started/project_ideas)
    list. Successful applicants will be able to expand and enhance the
    proposed project idea with a timeline of design and implementation
    milestones, and will demonstrate curiosity and motivation for the
    topic.

10. Download and complete the
    [Submitty GSoC Applicant Template](/developer/google_summer_of_code/applicant_template).
   
    You will document your skills, relevant coursework, non-course experience, and future
    career goals that qualify you to work on this project.

    The template will also ask for your approximate schedule for the
    summer: start date, end date, and number of hours of work per week.
    And a description of any classes, employment, or other time
    commitments during that time period.  

    Most importantly, you will summarize your engagement with the
    Submitty project team during the application period.  This includes
    participation in public discussions on our [Zulip server](/contact),
    authoring of new pull requests (both in progress and merged), and
    detailed and constructive reviews of PRs from other developers.
