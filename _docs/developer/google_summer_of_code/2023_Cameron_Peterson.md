## Google Summer of Code 2023
My project for Google Summer of Code 2023 was to improve Submitty's Continuous Integration pipeline by both adding tests to increase code coverage, and improving the test time for faster feedback to developers. My first few PR's weren't directly related to testing, but they gave me an in-depth knowledge of the codebase, which allowed me to optimize and refactor existing tests. 

## Gradeable Creation
My first few PR's related to GSOC 2023 were focusing on adding other ways to submit assignments to Submitty. The first PR was to add support for externally created Verson Control System (VCS) repositories. In doing so, I was able to get in-depth knowledge on how Submitty handled obtaining, and grading homework assignments, which was helpful for later testing improvements. The second PR was adding support for subdirectories within a repository. This gave me more knowledge on how gradeables were created, and how they were handled behind the scenes. The next two PR's were quality of life changes for the two previous PR's, one giving the ability to change the subdirectory settings after the gradeable was created, and one changing the error messages that the students receive on the event of a bad submission.
