### Mobile-Friendly Website and Progressive Web App (PWA)


This project was focused on making submitty mobile friendly and a progressive web-app with adding push notification feature but during the summer I worked equally on number of other features which involved adding and updating database, writing SQL queries and adding corresponding migrations file. I also added unit tests for different Models and used Selenium (with python) to write end-to-end tests.


To sum things up, this was a great full-stack project and I enjoyed working on all the major parts of Submitty! 

1. Designs, created designs for new TA grading interface and some other mobile-focussed components and iterated over it based on awesome feedback from the entire Submitty team :).
Tool Used: Figma  
2. Views (Frontend), improved existing User interface, made pages compatible with different screen sizes and added some new interfaces also. 
Tech Used: Figma, HTML, Twig, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, JQuery, Service-Workers
3. Models and Controllers (Backend), worked on different models and played a lot with database while adding new pages, views and implementing new feature requests.
Tech Used: PHP, PostgreSQL, Datagrip, SQLAlchemy, Vagrant     
4. Testing, during the summer I added unit-tests for the Models which were not covered by tests and also added end-to-end tests.
Tech Used: Selenium, Python, PHPUnit, TravisCI

#### Overall Experience

I got introduced to Submitty last year and from the very beginning, I loved the Submitty's objective and friendly environment, thanks to [Matthew Peveler](https://github.com/MasterOdin) for helping me with the onboarding and valueable feedbacks through your reviews.
I am very thankful to [Barbara Cutler](https://github.com/bmcutler), Submitty, RPI, and the GSoC team for giving me this chance and for bringing in this amazing experience full of learning and fun.
Complete project involved a lot of learning and challenges. I loved collaborating with RPI faculty and students and enjoyed working on the project used by not only RPI but a number of other universities across the globe.
During the whole summer, all of my project mentors were super awesome and super supportive and I learned a lot from them. Special thanks to [Barbara Cutler](https://github.com/bmcutler), [Eli Schiff](https://github.com/elihschiff), [Shail Patel](https://github.com/shailpatels), [Evan Maicus](https://github.com/emaicus), [Matthew Peveler](https://github.com/MasterOdin). They helped me with designing the new interface and gave me interesting developer tips during the whole project, I also enjoyed reviewing other developers code. 
It was a really great experience working and interacting with all the passionate RPI developers and fellow GSoC developers during the meeting we have had.
