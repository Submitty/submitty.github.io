If you are having trouble being able to view the Submitty webpage after a ```vagrant up``` you might need to 
modify the interfaces in your VM. To fix this:

As root modify ```/etc/network/interfaces``` and add:

```
# The host-only network interface
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.56.101
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.56.0
broadcast 192.168.56.255
```

During the install of the various packages referenced on [Vm Install Using Vagrant](/developer/vm_install_using_vagrant),
you might have ran into a few errors along the way. Below are a few common errors, and what you can do to solve them.

**Ubuntu Installation**

The following errors were experienced and fixed on a Ubuntu 16.04 distribution.

1. Ruby undefined method when running command (for vagrant version 1.8.1):

   ```
   sudo vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
   ```

   Error message recieved:

    	from /usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/vagrant/environment.rb:268:in `cli'
    	from /usr/bin/vagrant:173:in `<main>'
   ```

   In order to solve this, you can patch vagrant's ruby bundler (solution taken from: [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36991648/3646475))  

   Create a file named _vagrant-plugin.patch_:

   ```

2. zlib is missing; necessary for building libxml2 when running command:

   Error message recieved:

  Bundler, the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins,
  reported an error. The error is shown below. These errors are usually
  caused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network
  issues. The error from Bundler is:

  An error occurred while installing nokogiri (1.8.0), and Bundler cannot continue.
  Make sure that `gem install nokogiri -v '1.8.0'` succeeds before bundling.

  Warning: this Gemfile contains multiple primary sources. Using `source` more than once without a block is a security risk, and may result in installing unexpected gems. To resolve this warning, use a block to indicate which gems should come from the secondary source. To upgrade this warning to an error, run `bundle config disable_multisource true`.Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

  To see why this extension failed to compile, please check the mkmf.log which can be found here:

  extconf failed, exit code 1

  Gem files will remain installed in /home/user/.vagrant.d/gems/gems/nokogiri-1.8.0 for inspection.
  Results logged to /home/user/.vagrant.d/gems/extensions/x86_64-linux/2.3.0/nokogiri-1.8.0/gem_make.out
  ```

   In order to solve this make sure that the system has installed packages _lblzma-dev_ and _zliblg-dev_

   This can be done so by running:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev
   ```
