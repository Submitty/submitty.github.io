If you are having trouble being able to view the Submitty webpage after a ```vagrant up``` you might need to 
modify the interfaces in your VM. To fix this:

As root modify ```/etc/network/interfaces``` and add:

```
# The host-only network interface
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.56.101
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.56.0
broadcast 192.168.56.255
```
