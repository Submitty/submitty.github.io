## Connecting to Vagrant DB Locally

   The Vagrant VM sets up PostgreSQL such that you can access it from
   within the VM as well as from outside it for ease of development. When
   you start Vagrant, it will map the port 5432 inside the VM to the port
   16432 outside the VM. You can then connect by specifying localhost for
   the host and then `submitty_${SEMESTER}_${COURSE}` (replacing
   `${SEMESTER}` and `${COURSE}` with the actual one you want) for the DB
   to connect to. The user and password are both `submitty_dbuser`. All tables are then
   located in the `public` schema.

   We recommed that to connect to the DB that you use one of the following
   options ranging from simplest to most powerful.

   1. [psql](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html) (CLI for connecting to PostgreSQL)
   2. [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) (GUI for connecting to PostgreSQL) 
   3. [navicat](https://www.navicat.com/en/products/navicat-for-postgresql) (GUI for managing PostgreSQL)
   4. [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) ("Database IDE", can connect to most DB types)
