title: JSON Configuration Files
category: Developer
order: 5
---

The system configuration and state are stored in several different
types of JSON data files.  demonstration purposes we assume the system
has a user "smithj" and assignment "hw1".  The examples below are
relative to a top level course path
```/var/local/submitty/courses/f16/csci1100/```, for assignment ```hw1``` and
student ```smithj```. Listed are first the JSON files and then
examples of these JSON files.

Each line is preceded by a comment in the structure of ```//
[type|default] comment```


**config/form/form_\<gradeable_id\>.json**: The last set of data exported from the "Gradeable" form when a gradeable is created/updated. These files may be imported in bulk from the "Import From JSON" option. [{config}/form/form_\<gradeble_id\>.json] 

**config/build/build_\<gradeable_id\>.json**: Details on specific automated tests for this assignment

**user_assignment_settings.json**: Data for which version the user wants to submit as the final assignment as well as history of version changes [{submission}/hw1/smithj/user_assignment_settings.json]

**submission.json**: All data about a specific user submission [{results}/hw1/smithj/1/submission.json]


**.grade.timestamp**: Timestamp data about a specific user submission [{results}/hw1/smithj/1/submission.json




## \*_assignment_config.json
The \* would be equivalent to the ```assignment_id``` field in ```class.json``` as well as the ```id``` field in this json file. This file is generated when you build an assignment from it's ```config.json``` file.
```
{
    // [String] assignment id, should match the first part of the filename as well as field in class.json
    "id": "hw01",

    ],

    "testcases": [
        {
            // [String|""] Name of the test case to be displayed to the user
            "title": "Test 1 README",
            // [String|""] Additional details about the test such as command used to run the test case 
            "details": "",

            "points": 2,

            "extracredit": false,

            "visible": true,
            // [Boolean|true] Doesn't do anything?
            "points_visible": true
        }
    ]
}
```

## user_assignment_settings.json
```
{
    // [Integer] What's the active version of the assignment, a 0 signifies that it's been cancelled
    "active_version": 1,
    // [Array(Objects)|[]] history of the active version changes that a user has done. This is ordered earliest to latest.
    "history": [
        {
            // [Integer] Version that user had changed to
            "version": 1,
            // [String] Timestamp of when user changed to this particular version
            "time": "2016-07-24 12:05:35"
        }
    ]
}
```

Proposed changes:
* change ```active_assignment``` to ```active_version```
