## Purpose
Website accessibility is a design paradigm that helps computer users with
physical impairments to fully and completely use a website's services.
While not an exhaustive list, those with physical impairments could include
vision impairments â€” such as color blindness or low vision, and motor
impairments that prevent the use of a mouse.

For the purposes of Submitty development, "VPAT" refers to website
accessibility.  VPAT is actually a report of accessibility implementations in
information and communications technology that is required of any institute
receiving federal grants under [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973)
