### Internal Git

Submitty is setup to allow submissions from a Git repository instead
of through the drag-and-drop interface.  While some people may use
Github, Gitlab, etc. to host their students' repositories, some
sysadmins may wish to host the Git repositories internally, on the
same server as Submitty.

Note: For the rest of this documentation, we assume that it's fine
that Git will live as a subdirectory off the primary URL of
Submitty. That means if the URL was https://example.com, then Git
would be at https://example.com/git.

#### Apache2 Configuration

To setup the internal Git, you will have to setup a separate URL from
your main Submitty installation and create a separate VirtualHost for
it, due to the use of suexec within our main configuration.

Copy the following code into `/etc/apache2/sites-available/submitty.conf`:

```
    ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/local/submitty/site/cgi-bin/git-http-backend/

    # Override the Require ip from cgi-bin Directory section to
    # allow outside access
    <Location "/git">
        Require all granted
    </Location>

    <Directory /usr/lib/git-core>
        Options +ExecCGI +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    <Files "git-http-backend">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Git Access"
        AuthBasicProvider wsgi
        WSGIAuthUserScript /usr/local/submitty/sbin/authentication.py
        #Require expr !(%{QUERY_STRING} -strmatch '*service=git-receive-pack*' || %{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#/git-receive-pack$#)
        Require valid-user
    </Files>
```

Authentication for Git is handled by
`/usr/local/submitty/sbin/authentication.py` through the Python3 WSGI
module for Apache2 (mod_wsgi) which allows us to utilize a python
script to handle the authentication process for repository
access. Unfortunately, do to limitations within the module, the user
that runs this script must be the same user that own the Apache2
process. To limit access to any criticial information by a user that
isn't handled by Submitty, the authentication script goes through a
REST API endpoint within Submitty built specifically for the VCS
process.

Any action that someone does on Git (cloning, pulling, pushing, etc.)
will require authentication. The authentication is checked in the
following way:

1. Does the given username/password exist on the server. If not, return False.
2. Does the username match the username for the repo we're checking out? If so, return True.
3. Is this a team assignment and is the username on the list of users for the team id for the repo? If so, return True.
3. Does the username exist within the given semester and course for the repository? If not, return False.
4. Is the user in the course either a TA or instructor account? If so, return True, else return False.


#### Generating Repositories

_Note: In order for instructors to use the `generate_reps.py` script,
instructors for courses needing repositories should be given limited
sudo access to run this script.  For example, you may create a group
named `submitty_repo_gen` that has sudo access to this command, and
add the instructors to this group._



#### Grading Repositories

To grade a repository, Submitty must have access to it through the `submitty_daemon` user. 

If you're only using internal repositories (those located under `/var/local/submitty/vcs/git`), then you don't 
need to do anything futher to support grading these, as if the VCS URL is detected as having the submission url,
it will replace that URL with the absolute file path for `submitty_daemon` to use to checkout.

An example of this would be that you set the submission url to be "https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu" and give the VCS url
for a gradeable to be "https://submitty.cs.rpi.edu/{$vcs_type}/{$course}/{$semester}/{$gradeable_id}/{$user_id}", 
then `submitty_daemon` will subsitute in the full absolute path
`/var/local/submitty/vcs/{$vcs_type}/{$semester}/{$course}/{$gradeable_id}/{$user_id}` to use.

### Using External Git

If you're using external repos and websites unconnected to Submitty, then you'll need to setup `submitty_daemon` to
have access to those repos via SSH. Instructions for adding an SSH key to your account is available for 
[Github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) and 
[Gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/). The gist of these is as follows for Linux (focusing on Github):

1. Login to the submitty_daemon user.
1. Open a terminal and generate a new SSH key:
`
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
`
1. Enter file location for ssh key. (ex: /home/submitty_daemon/.ssh/id_github)
1. Enter a passphrase for the SSH key.
1. Add the key to the ssh-agent. (See [this article](http://mah.everybody.org/docs/ssh#run-ssh-agent) 
   on setting up ssh-agent to start on login).
1. Add the SSH key to your Github/Gitlab/etc account.

Then, for a given assignment, you'll want to set the base of the URL to be
`ssh://git@github.com/` or whatever the base of ssh is for your external resource.

#### Assignment Configuration

To link a new gradeable to the repositories, for the question: "Are
students uploading files or submitting to a Version Control System
(VCS) repository?", select "Version Control System (VCS) Repository".

and you should be fine using just:

```
{$gradeable_id}/{$user_id}/
```

for most assignments. This will be combined with the configured VCS base URL for your system. By default, this will
point at the internal url for VCS, which is your Submitty URL with `{$vcs_type}/` appended.
