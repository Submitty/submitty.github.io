Submitty includes the ability for instructors to automatically generate rainbow grades by following the 
[automatic setup instructions](../instructor/rainbow_grades/automatic_setup).  For this feature to work the Submitty 
server must have the [RainbowGrades](https://github.com/Submitty/RainbowGrades) repository checked out.
