Beginning with version
[v20.06.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v20.06.00)
of the main Submitty repository, we have added a new WebSocket
interface.  Future Submitty releases will leverage WebSockets for
dynamic content on frequently changing pages including the TA grading
interfaces, discussion forum, and office hour queue *without a manual
page refresh*.  To enable WebSockets, you will need to add the
following lines to your apache site configuration file for Submitty:

1. Go to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`

2. Find the appropriate `.conf` file.

   _Note: If you have multiple files, you can double check which
   configurations are linked (and thus in-use) from the
   `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory._

3. Make the modification below somewhere in the file under the
top-level VirtualHost directive. 

    ```text
        ProxyPass "/ws"  "ws://127.0.0.1:41983/"
    ```

   For an example of placement, see our example 
   [apache conf file](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/apache/submitty.conf).

4. Restart apache: `systemctl restart apache2`

5. Install the new Submitty software:

    ```bash
    /usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh
    ```

6. Enable the websocket server systemd unit so that it automatically
starts on restarts of the server:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable submitty_websocket_server
    ```

7. Start the WebSocket daemon:

    ```bash
    systemctl start submitty_websocket_server
    ```

8. Verify that the daemon is running:

    ```bash
    systemctl status submitty_websocket_server
    ```
