Release
[v22.06.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v22.06.00)
adds a new Postgres database user/role for course database access
that is not a database superuser.

Before installing this new version, you should specify the username
and password for this new database user/role.  You do not need to
create the user/role for the database, the migration will create the
user/role if it does not exist.

1.  As root, edit the file `/usr/local/submitty/config/database.json`

    Add the following lines to the file:

    ```
    "database_course_user": "submitty_course_dbuser",
    "database_course_password": "PASSWORD",
    ```

    Replacing `PASSWORD` with a secure password.  You may optionally
    specify an alternate username for this database user/role.


2.  Pull the latest code from the repostiroy, and run the installation
    script:

    ```
    sudo /usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh
    ```
