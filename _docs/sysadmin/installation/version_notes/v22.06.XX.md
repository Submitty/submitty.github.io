Release [v22.06.XX](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v22.06.XX)
includes an update to the Apache2 server's module and configuration:

- Module `php7.4`[^PHP] and `mpm_prefork` are disabled;

- Module `mpm_event` and `http2` are enabled;

- TLS is enabled by default in the development environment.

---

Despite the automatic system migration, please follow these steps to
upgrade the Apache2 server *before* updating to this version.

1. If there are load balancers and firewalls in front of the Apache
   server of Submitty, please make sure they support HTTP/2 redirections.

2. *(Migrator will also handle this)*

   Disable `php7.4`[^PHP] and `mpm_prefork` by `a2dismod php7.4 mpm_prefork`;

3. *(Migrator will also handle this)*

   Enable `mpm_event` and `http2` by `a2enmod mpm_event http2`;

4. Activate the TLS encryption for Submitty;

5. Tune the performance for `php-fpm` and `mpm_event` at [^PHP]
   ```
   /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/submitty.conf
   /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_event.conf
   ```

6. Final check for Apache2's configuration;
   ```sh
   apachectl -t
   ```

7. Reload Apache2 to apply changes.

8. Run the update script.
