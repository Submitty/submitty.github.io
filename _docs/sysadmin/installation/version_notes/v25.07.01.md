Release [v25.07.01](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v25.07.01)
includes an update to Python's SQLAlchemy package.
As this package is vital to database migrations, which are run
before installing new Python packages, we need to manually update this package.


1. Install the newest python packages first.

```sh
sudo bash /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty/.setup/update_system.sh
```

2. Run the regular install script.

```sh
sudo /usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh
```
