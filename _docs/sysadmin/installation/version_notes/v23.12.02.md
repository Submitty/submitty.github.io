Release [v23.12.02](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v23.12.02)
includes an update to the Apache2 server's module and configuration to
disable `php8.1` and `mpm_prefork` and enable `mpm_event` and `http2`.
Note:  Submitty uses `php8.1-fpm` NOT `php8.1`.


1. If you have load balancers and firewalls in front of the Apache
   server for Submitty, please make sure they support HTTP/2
   redirections.

2. Disable `php8.1` and `mpm_prefork`:

   ```
   a2dismod php8.1 mpm_prefork
   ```

3. Enable `mpm_event` and `http2`:

   ```
   a2enmod mpm_event http2
   ```

4. If you are not already using TLS/SSL HTTPS encryption for Submitty,
   we strongly recommend enabling it.  See 
   [System Administrator Installation Instructions](https://submitty.org/sysadmin/installation/index).

5. Review your current performance tuning for `php-fpm`.  
   ```
   /etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/submitty.conf
   ```
   You will probably not need to change these settings.

6. With the switch from `mpm_prefork` to `mpm_event`, you will probably want to take any customization from this file:
   ``` 
   /etc/apache2/mods-available/mpm_prefork.conf
   ```

   And adapt it to this file:
   ```
   /etc/apache2/mods-available/mpm_event.conf
   ```
   
6. Final check for Apache2's configuration;
   ```sh
   apachectl -t
   ```

7. Reload Apache2 to apply changes.

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
   sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm
   ```

8. Run the update script.

   ```
   sudo /usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh
   ```

NOTE:  If you need to downgrade from HTTP/2 back to HTTP/1.1 and re-enable `mpm_prefork`,
please follow the steps below:

1. Disable `http2` and `mpm_event`:

   ```
   a2dismod http2 mpm_event
   ```

2. Enable `mpm_prefork`:

   ```
   a2enmod mpm_prefork
   ```

3. Alternatively, if the PHP does not use a `fpm` server, consider enabling
   `php8.1` by `a2enmod php8.1`.
