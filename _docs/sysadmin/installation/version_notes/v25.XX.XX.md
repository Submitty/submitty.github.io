Release [v25.XX.XX](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v23.XX.XX)
includes an update to Python's SQLAlchemy package.
As this package is vital to database migrations, which are always ran before installing new Python packages, we need to manually update this package.


1. Install the newest python packages first.

```sh
sudo /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty/.setup/update_system.sh
```

2. Run the regular install script.

```sh
sudo /usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh
```
