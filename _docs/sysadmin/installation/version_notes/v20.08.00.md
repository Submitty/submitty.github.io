To support the expanded use of Websockets for additional dynamic pages
within the Submitty website, we must remove a restriction on a
specific php function.

Version
[v20.08.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v20.08.00)
requires the following edits:

1. Locate your `php.ini` file.

   _It is probably something like `/etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini`._

   Note: You can run this command to print your specific version of php:

   ```
   php -r 'print PHP_MAJOR_VERSION.".".PHP_MINOR_VERSION."\n";'
   ```

2. Edit this file:  
   Remove `stream_socket_client` from the list of `disabled_functions`.  
   Save the file.


3. Restart php fpm:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart php7.2-fpm
   ```

   Or more generally:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart php$(php -r 'print PHP_MAJOR_VERSION.".".PHP_MINOR_VERSION;')-fpm
   ```
