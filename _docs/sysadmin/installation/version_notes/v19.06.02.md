For this release we need to add one additional line to the Apache
configuration to pass the authorization header information to PHP:

```
   SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1 
```

Overall, follow the same
[instructions to restart Apache as in the previous release v.19.06.01](v.19.06.01).


This new line will be in the section for `/url/local/submitty/site/public`:

```
   <Directory /usr/local/submitty/site/public>
        Require all granted
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all

        RewriteEngine On

        # If the requested filename exists, simply serve it.                                             
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
        RewriteRule ^ - [L]

        # Else rewrite urls to use index.php, however we have to be aware of two                         
        # possible conditions of whether index.php is in the URL already or not.                         
        # To be backwards compatible, we want to ensure that having /index.php                           
        # is valid and usable. In anycase, we rewrite everything up-to /index.php                        
        # to be the "url" parameter of the query, and then append whatever else we                       
        # had in the QUERY_STRING after it.                                                              
        RewriteRule ^(.+)/index\.php$ /index.php?url=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [NC,END]
        RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php?url=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [NC,END]

        SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1 

    </Directory>
```
