Release [v22.05.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v22.05.00)
includes an update to the configuration of the socket server for security purposes.
As part of the reconfiguration, a manual edit of the NGINX config is necessary.

Follow these steps to reconfigure the socket server.

1. Edit your NGINX configuration `/etc/nginx/sites-available/submitty.conf` and find the line:
    ```
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:41983/; #Yes, http is proper here for nginx web socket
    ```
    and change it to:
    ```
    proxy_pass http://unix:/var/local/submitty/run/websocket/server.sock:;
    ```

    NOTE: This assumes your data directory is at `/var/local/submitty`. If it isn't, change the path accordingly.

2. Run the install script
