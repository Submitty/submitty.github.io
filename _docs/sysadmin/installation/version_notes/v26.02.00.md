Release [v26.02.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v26.02.00)
includes an update to PHP from 8.1 to 8.2.

A migration exists which will do the following:
1. Uninstall PHP 8.1
2. Install PHP 8.2
3. Configure PHP 8.2's `php.ini` file for a normal system installation
4. Copy `submitty.conf` from `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d` to `/etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d`

`/etc/php/8.1` is not deleted or modified in any way during this process.

Ensure any custom configuration from `/etc/php/8.1` is copied over to `/etc/php/8.2`.
Once complete, `/etc/php/8.1` can be deleted.
