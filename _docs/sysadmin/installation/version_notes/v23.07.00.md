Release [v23.07.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v23.07.00)
includes software updates to run on Ubuntu 22.04 and PHP8.

1. Unfortunately, these updates WILL NOT run on a default
   Ubuntu 20.04 / PHP 7.4 system, so it is required that you
   update your primary server's operating system,
   and the operating system of any autograding worker machines
   before installing Submitty v23.07.00.

2. The list of disabled PHP functions must also be updated to remove
   `chmod`.  `chmod` must now be allowed.  See also
