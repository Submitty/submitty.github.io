Release [v23.03.01](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v23.03.01)
includes an update to the rewrite rules to correctly encode special characters
after [Apache 2.4.56 security update](https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html).

_Note: Without this update, a few Submitty features will be buggy; for
example, attempting to acces Course Materials filepaths that include
spaces or use Office Hour Queue names that include spaces will cause
"Forbidden - You don't have permission to access this resource" errors._

Follow these steps to modify your rewrite rules.

1. Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-available/submitty.conf` and find the lines:

    ```
    RewriteRule ^(.+)/index\.php$ /index.php?url=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [NC,END]
    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php?url=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [NC,END]
    ```

    and edit/replace those lines to add the `B,`

    ```
    RewriteRule ^(.+)/index\.php$ /index.php?url=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [B,NC,END]
    RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /index.php?url=$1&%{QUERY_STRING} [B,NC,END]
    ```

2.  Restart Apache

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
    ```
