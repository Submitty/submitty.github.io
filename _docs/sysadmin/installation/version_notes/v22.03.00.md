Release [v22.03.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v22.03.00)
includes an update to improve the flexibility of routing, such that URLs with trailing
slashes will automatically redirect to the URL without the trailing slash. This is an
improvement on prior behavior where the redirect would be to the Submitty home page.

Follow these steps to enable this new functionality.

1. Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-available/submitty.conf` and find the line:

    ```
    RewriteEngine On
    ```

    and append after it:

    ```
    # Routing Flexibility: Removes the trailing slash if it is supplied
    # Example: /courses/f21/csci1200/ -> /courses/f21/csci1200
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /(.*)/$
    RewriteRule ^ /%1 [R=301,L]
    ```

2.  Restart Apache

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
    ```
