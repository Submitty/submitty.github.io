Release [v21.11.01](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v21.11.01)
updates the version of Node.js to 16.x.  Doing this on existing Submitty
instances requires the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list` to be
manually edited to update the version of Node.js.  The current version of Node.js
may be determined by running `node -v`.

The file should be edited to the following:

```
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_16.x focal main
deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_16.x focal main
```

Replace `focal` above with whatever the name of Ubuntu you are running. You can get this information by
running `lsb_release -cs` in the terminal.

After editing the file, the system must be updated by running the following
commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

The new version of Node.js can be verified by running `node -v`.
