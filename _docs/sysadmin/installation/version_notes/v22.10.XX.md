Release [v22.10.XX](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v22.10.XX)
includes a sysadmin update to the Apache2 server's module and configuration:

- Module `php7.4`[^PHP] and `mpm_prefork` should be disabled;

- Module `mpm_event` and `http2` should be enabled;

- TLS could be enabled in the development environment to test HTTP/2 related
  functions.

---

Please follow these steps to upgrade the Apache2 server:

1. If there are load balancers and firewalls in front of the Apache
   server of Submitty, please make sure they support HTTP/2 redirections.

2. Disable `php7.4`[^PHP] and `mpm_prefork` by `a2dismod php7.4 mpm_prefork`;

3. Enable `mpm_event` and `http2` by `a2enmod mpm_event http2`;

4. Activate the TLS encryption for Submitty;

5. Tune the performance for `php-fpm` and `mpm_event` at [^PHP]
   ```
   /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/submitty.conf
   /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mpm_event.conf
   ```

6. Final check for Apache2's configuration;
   ```sh
   apachectl -t
   ```

7. Reload Apache2 to apply changes.

8. Run the update script.

---

If you need to downgrade the HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 and re-enable `mpm_prefork`, 
please follow the steps below:

1. Disable `http2` and `mpm_event` by `a2dismod http2 mpm_event`;

2. Enable `mpm_prefork` by `a2enmod mpm_prefork`;

3. Alternatively, if the PHP does not use a `fpm` server, consider enabling
   `phpX.X`[^PHP] by `a2enmod phpX.X`.

---

For developers who need to upgrade to HTTP/2 in their development environments,
please follow the step below:

1. Run `bash .setup/dev-upgrade-h2.sh up`.

For downgrading to HTTP/1.1, run `bash .setup/dev-upgrade-h2.sh down`

The script should automatically handle the upgrade and issueing a self-signed
certificate.  If your browser complains about the security, please head to
[WebSocket](/developer/developing_the_php_site/websocket).

[^PHP]: Change the PHP version to the deployed version if needed.
