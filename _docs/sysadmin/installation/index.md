These instructions will help guide you to installing Submitty onto a
server (whether on a dedicated machine or a VM).

**Note**: We assume that you're installing Submitty on a dedicated machine. If this machine is
used for other things, you may need to adapt the instructions below and
[install_system.sh](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/install_system.sh)
for your needs (as the script installs all of the dependencies that Submitty depends on).

**Note:** Part of the installation process consists of changing the default umask
for users from 002 to 027 to better protect the files that Submitty generates
during operation as well as any instructors who are SSHing into the machine and
so as to not potentially allow other access to confidential material. This does
mean that installing certain things (like python packages through pip) into a
global scope will need to have their permissions updated or else only the owner
will be able to read/execute it.

_Note: These instructions should be run under root/sudo._

We have two methods for installing Submitty. The first method is running the bootstrap
script which follows the set of instructions listed below. The second installation method uses Ansible.
You can use these [instructions](/sysadmin/installation/ansible).


1. [Install Ubuntu 22.04 server edition (or other supported distro)](/sysadmin/installation/server_os)

   Note: If you are duplicating an existing Submitty installation onto a new server, you should
   synchronize `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group`, and `/etc/gshadow` before installing
   the rest of Submitty to avoid mismatched UIDs and GIDs of the Submitty users.

2. Run the bootstrap script:
   ```
   bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Submitty/Submitty/master/.setup/bootstrap.sh)"
   ```

   or clone the git repository and run the installer (requires git and lsb-release to be installed):

   ```
   mkdir -p /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT
   git clone https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty.git /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty
   cd /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty
   bash ./.setup/install_system.sh
   ```

   Note: During installation, you will be asked several questions by the
   [CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py)
   script. Pressing enter will select the default option. These questions are:
   1. **Database Host / Port**. If you already have your database server installed and set up, you
   will most likely just specify `localhost` for the Database Host and
   `5432` for the Database Port, or just `/var/run/postgresql` for
   Database Host.
   2. **Submitty Database User/Role and Password**. This is *not* a Linux user, just a user/role within the database server. If you don't already have a role for the submitty database user/role, the script will create that for you with the specified name & password.
   3. **Timezone**. Pick from the list of [PHP timezones](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php).
   4. **Main Site URL**.
   5. **Version Control System (VCS) URL**. This is used mostly to allow students to submit their homework through private repositories hosted on the submitty server. See [Facilitating Student Submissions via GIT](/instructor/managing_git).
   6. **Institution Name**.
   7. **Authentication Method**. PAM and LDAP authentication requires the sysadmin to make accounts ahead of time for students and give them a password. Database authentication lets students create their own passwords.



3. Run installations specific to your university.
   For example:  [RPI Computer Science specific installations](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/distro_setup/ubuntu/rpi.sh)

   ```
   sudo bash /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty/.setup/distro_setup/ubuntu/rpi.sh
   ```


4. Edit PHP Settings

   We recommend for security that you modify your PHP installation and disable certain PHP functions.
   To do this, edit `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/php.ini`  and find the entry for `disable_functions` and make sure the list of
   disabled functions contains:

   ```
   popen,pclose,proc_open,php_real_logo_guid,php_egg_logo_guid,php_ini_scanned_files,php_ini_loaded_file,readlink,symlink,link,set_file_buffer,proc_close,proc_terminate,proc_get_status,proc_nice,getmyuid,getmygid,getmyinode,putenv,get_current_user,magic_quotes_runtime,set_magic_quotes_runtime,import_request_variables,ini_alter,stream_socket_server,stream_socket_accept,stream_socket_pair,stream_get_transports,stream_wrapper_restore,mb_send_mail,openlog,syslog,closelog,pfsockopen,posix_kill,apache_child_terminate,apache_get_modules,apache_get_version,apache_lookup_uri,apache_reset_timeout,apache_response_headers,virtual,system,phpinfo,exec,shell_exec,passthru,disk_free_space,disk_total_space,diskfreespace,getlastmo,getmypid,extract,parse_str,mail,fsockopen,posix_setpgid,posix_setsid,posix_setuid,exif_read_data,read_exif_data,exif_thumbnail,exif_imagetype,tempnam,
   ```

   _Note: Depending on your version of Ubuntu, your version of php fpm will be different._

5. Setup Apache

   To access Submitty's web interface, you will need to setup Apache for it.
   To help you along, we provide an annotated apache configuration for Submitty at
   [.setup/apache/submitty.conf](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/apache/submitty.conf)
   which you can copy to `/etc/apache2/sites-available/submitty.conf`. You will
   need to replace all instances of `__your_domain__` with your actual
   domain / IP (don't include the `https://` part of it).

   The basic commands to do this are:
   ```
   cp /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty/.setup/apache/submitty.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/submitty.conf
   a2ensite submitty
   ```

   The annotated apache configuration above is setup only for HTTP. For production
   systems, we highly recommend setting up SSL/HTTPS for the server. If your institute
   or organization does not have a centralized SSL provider to use, we recommend
   using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get one through their
   [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) tool, which should handle upgrading the Submitty
   apache configuration to SSL for you. The generated certificates will
   be available under `/etc/letsencrypt/live/__your_domain__`. If going through
   a centralized provider, they should provide instructions about where to place
   the certificates (commonly at `/etc/ssl` or `/etc/apache2/ssl`) and the changes
   necessary for Apache. See [this page](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_howto.html)
   for more details about the various settings for SSL.

   Note: It's recommended that after setting up SSL, that you add the following block to
   redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS:
   ```
   <VirtualHost __your_domain__:80>
        ServerName __your_domain__
        Redirect / https://__your_domain__/
   </Virtualhost>
   ```

   We also recommend that you edit `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf` to ensure
   these options below are set to limit the information the server
   gives to potential hackers:

   ```
   ServerTokens Prod
   ServerSignature Off
   ```

   You probably want to first disable or remove the default
   configurations to prevent unintended access to the web server (but
   donâ€™t do this if the default site is already in use).

   ```
   a2dissite 000-default
   ```

   You may also want to comment out the directory specific portions of
   ``` /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ``` so that you do not risk
   configuration conflicts with your other configurations.  (Things
   that begin with Directory and end with /Directory).

   At this point, you should be able to access the site by going to `your_domain`
   through a browser.

6. Configure NGINX

   Submitty uses a NGINX server to proxy the websocket server. By default
   the websocket server will run without HTTPS. If Apache is configured with
   HTTPS then websockets must also be configured with HTTPS or they will
   not connect. To setup HTTPS on NGINX,
   modify `/etc/nginx/sites-available/submitty.conf` and put the following:

   ```
   server {
       # SSL configuration
       listen 8443 ssl default_server;
       listen [::]:8443 ssl default_server;

       #dont show OS or version identity
       server_tokens off; 

       ssl on;
       ssl_certificate /etc/apache2/ssl/submitty-demo.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/apache2/ssl/submitty-demo.key;
       ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
       ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:AES128-SHA:RC4-SHA;
       ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;

       server_name _;

       location / {
           return 404;
       }

       location /ws {
           proxy_pass http://unix:/var/local/submitty/run/websocket/server.sock:;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
       }
   }
   ```

   You should modify the values for `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`
   to point to your SSL certificate and private key.

   To create the `.pem` file required by NGINX, combine the existing
   `chain.cer` cert chain with the `submitty.cer` file:

   ```
   cp submitty.cer submitty.pem
   cat chain.cer >> submitty.pem
   ```

7. We recommend that you should leave the PostgreSQL setup unless you know what
   you're doing. If you are running PostgreSQL on the same server as Submitty,
   we recommend using the UNIX socket, and to disable TCP if unused. By default,
   the socket is found at `/var/run/postgresql`, and disabling TCP is done through
   editing the [`pg_hba.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)
   file for PostgreSQL. Using the socket improves query responses as it will not
   need to go through the TCP stack. Disabling TCP if not used will improve security
   as it prevents anyone from attempting to get into the DB from the outside
   world. To disable TCP, you would comment out all the lines that start with `host`
   and `hostssl` in the `pg_hba.conf` file. Setting the socket to be used for
   Submitty is done by running `.setup/CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py` and setting the
   database host to the socket (e.g. `/var/run/postgresql`).

   NOTES:
   - If you intend to run the [Student Registration Feed](/sysadmin/configuration/registration_feed), do not
     disable TCP.

8. Test apache config with:  `apache2ctl -t`

   If everything looks ok, restart apache with:  `service apache2 restart'


9. We suggest reviewing [Additional System Customizations](/sysadmin/installation/system_customization)
    that might be appropriate for your installation.


### Troubleshooting
- **I cannot connect to PAM!**
  1. Submitty authenticates PAM through the python module
     [python-pam](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pam/) using the
     `submitty_cgi` user. By default, we assume you're going to use local accounts
     for authentication and as such `submitty_cgi` has been added to the `shadow`
     group so that it can read /etc/password which is necessary for PAM to work.

     To test PAM, you can do:

     ```bash
     $ sudo su submitty_cgi -c python3
     Python 3.5.1 (default, Jun 29 2016, 13:08:31)
     [GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>> import pam
     >>> p = pam.pam()
     >>> p.authenticate('username', 'password')
     True
     ```

     (where `username` and `password` match some account on the machine).

     If you get an error about module pam not being found, that means that
     `submitty_cgi` does not have the proper permissions to the module and if
     you get False on authentication, then `submitty_cgi` does not have the
     proper permissions to check the right files via PAM.

  2. If the PAM module is functioning, but Submitty is still erroring during
     user authentication, check `/var/log/apache2/submitty.log` for these
     entries with a recent timestamp:

     1. `AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /usr/local/submitty/site/cgi-bin/pam_check.cgi`
     2. `POST /cgi-bin/pam_check.cgi HTTP/1.1" 403 470 "-" "-"`

     This indicates that apache is blocking the execution of Submitty's
     authentication code.  Try adding this line to `submitty.conf` under the
     heading `<Directory "/usr/local/submitty/site/cgi-bin">`.

     - `Require all granted`

- **Installation Fails During NTP Setup**

  1.  This is indicative that you installed the Ubuntu 2X.04 "Live" server.
      "Live" server is unsupported.  Please install the traditional server.
      Please see the [Server OS](/sysadmin/installation/server_os) page for more details.
