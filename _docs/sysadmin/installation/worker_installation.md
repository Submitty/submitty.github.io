A Submitty instance is capable of leveraging additional machines to
[distribute autograding load](/developer/development_instructions/automated_grading).
This capability can be used to ship jobs which require
additional resources or specialized hardware to appropriate machines.
This guide details the steps to install Submitty in worker mode,
and to configure the resulting worker machine
for use by a "Primary" Submitty instance.

Note: We assume that you're installing Submitty on a dedicated machine. If this machine is
used for other things, you may need to adapt the instructions below and
[install_system.sh](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/install_system.sh)
for your needs (as the script installs all of the dependencies that Submitty depends on).

_Note: These instructions should be run under root/sudo._


1. [Install Ubuntu 22.04 server edition](/sysadmin/installation/server_os)

2. Create a ```submitty``` user on the machine.  You may choose a different user name,
   but the user should only be used for submitty autograding.

3. Install git

   ```
   sudo apt install git
   ```

4. After installing the operating system, clone the git repository:

   ```
   mkdir -p /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT
   git clone https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty.git /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty
   ```
   Ensure ```/usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty``` is owned by the ```submitty``` user.
   The ```submitty``` user should be able to read/write to this directory.

5. Run the automated portion of the install, using the ```--worker``` option.

   ```
   cd /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty
   bash ./.setup/install_system.sh --worker
   ```

   You will be asked to provide the name of your submitty user by the
   [CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py script](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py).


6. Add the submitty user to the ```submitty_daemon```, ```submitty_daemonphp```, and ```docker```
   groups.

   ```
   sudo usermod -a -G submitty_daemon YOUR_SUBMITTY_USER
   sudo usermod -a -G submitty_daemonphp YOUR_SUBMITTY_USER
   sudo usermod -a -G docker YOUR_SUBMITTY_USER
   ```

7. Next, we must set up an ssh key so that submitty_daemon user on the primary
   machine can copy files to our worker machine.

   On primary submitty:  
   ___NOTE: ssh-keygen asks for the name of your submitty user.___  
   ___NOTE: The ssh-copy-id line requires a replacement___
   ```
   su submitty_daemon
   cd ~/
   ssh-keygen
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub SUBMITTY_USER@HOSTNAME
   ```

8. Finally, we must add the machine to the list of workers available to our
   primary machine. To do this:  
   *  Log on to the primary Submitty machine.
   *  Open ```/usr/local/submitty/config/autograding_workers.json``` with your favorite text editor.
   *  Add a new entry with a unique key.
   *  add at least one capability to the capabilities list. This capability will determine
      which jobs should be shipped to this machine.  See also
      [Automated Grading - Multiple Physical Servers](/developer/development_instructions/automated_grading#multiple-physical-servers)
   *  Add the 'address' of the machine to the address field (e.g. ```worker1.myuniversity.edu```).
   *  Add the number of autograding workers (simultaneously processed jobs) for the machine.
   *  Add the name of the submitty user on the machine as the username.
   *  Set the machine to be enabled.

9. Run ```/usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh``` on primary machine so that the changes take effect.

10. Inside of your assignment configurations, you may now add the line  
    ```
    required_capabilities : 'CAPABILITY'
    ```
    to ship your jobs to a worker with the capability CAPABILITY.



# Configuring SSH Access

1.  If your worker machine is directly accessible from the primary
    machine via an IP address in the public DNS servers, you may
    specify that machine by IP address or by name in the
    `/usr/local/submitty/config/autograding_workers.json` file.  E.g.:

    ```
    "worker1": {
        "capabilities": [
            "worker","worker1","default"
        ],
        "address": "1.2.3.4",
        "username": "submitty",
        "num_autograding_workers": 5,
        "enabled": true
    }
    ```

    or


    ```
    "worker1": {
        "capabilities": [
            "worker","worker1","default"
        ],
        "address": "worker1.myuniversity.edu",
        "username": "submitty",
        "num_autograding_workers": 5,
        "enabled": true
    }
    ```


2.  If the machine name is not in the DNS server, you may add a line to
    the `/etc/hosts` file on the primary machine linking a name of
    your choice to the IP address of the worker machine:

    ```
    1.2.3.4    worker1.myuniversity.edu
    ```

    And then you can use the machine name in the `autograding_workers.json` file.


3.  For security, you will probably want to restrict unwanted
    connections to the worker machine.  You can do this by first adding the
    following line to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file on the worker
    machine:

    ```
    sshd : ALL
    ```

    And then allow connections from the primary machine, by adding the
    following line to the `/etc/hosts.allow` file on the worker machine:

    ```
    # primarysubmitty.myuniversity.edu
    sshd : 5.6.7.8
    ```

4.  Test and confirm that the ssh key (previous instructions) is working
    and that the `submitty_daemon` user on the primary machine can
    connect via passwordless ssh to the worker machine using the
    `submitty` user.


# SSH Access via ProxyJump

If a worker machine must be accessed through an intermediary (e.g., it
does not have a its own public facing IP address), you can configure
indirect access to the worker machine as follows:


1.  Specify this indirect connection for the `submitty_daemon` user on
    the primary machine by adding the following lines to the
    `/home/submitty_daemon/.ssh/config` file:

    ```
    Host worker2.myuniversity.edu
    User submitty
    ProxyJump submitty@worker1.myuniversity.edu
    ```

    In this example, worker2 does not have its own public-facing IP
    address, but can be reached by going through worker1 as
    intermediary.


2.  Set up an ssh key (see instructions above) from the `submitty`
    user on `worker1.myuniversity.edu` to the `submitty` user on the
    `worker2.myuniversity.edu` machine.


3.  Test and confirm that the `submitty_daemon` user on the primary
    machine can connect via passwordless ssh to both the
    `worker1.myuniversity.edu` and `worker2.myuniversity.edu` machines
    (as the `submitty` user).


4.  You will also need to enable this connection for the root user
    (using the `submitty_daemon` user ssh keys) by adding the
    following lines to the `/root/.ssh/config` file:

    ```
    Host worker1.myuniversity.edu
    IdentityFile /home/submitty_daemon/.ssh/id_rsa

    Host worker2.myuniversity.edu
    User submitty
    ProxyJump submitty@worker1.myuniversity.edu
    IdentityFile /home/submitty_daemon/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```


5.  Test and confirm that the root user on the primary machine can
    connect via passwordless ssh to both the
    `worker1.myuniversity.edu` and `worker2.myuniversity.edu` machines
    (as the `submitty` user).


6.  Test the autograding of a submission that is targeted to a
    capability provided (only) by this worker machine.


# Graphics Application Worker Machines


1. Install these additional packages on worker machines that will be
   autograding graphical applications.  These packages will allow
   window and mouse control, screenshots, and image processing.

   ```
   sudo apt-get install wmctrl
   sudo apt-get install xdotool
   sudo apt-get install scrot
   sudo apt-get install imagemagick
   ```

2. To launch and screen capture graphics programs, it is necessary
   that a user (any user) be logged in to the machine.  Note that
   while autograding is in progress, the mouse and keyboard will be
   captured and controlled by the remote submitty process, so
   interactive usage of the machine will be disrupted.  For security,
   we suggest that this be the `submitty` user or other user with no
   access to sensitive data external to Submitty.


3. Configure that user's account so that the machine does not go to
   sleep, the screensaver is disabled, the screen does not lock
   (requiring a password to unlock), the screen does not go black, and
   the monitor does not go into power saving mode.

   Here are some of the settings to try:


   * `Settings -> Power -> Power Saving -> Blank Screen = Never`

   * `Settings -> Power -> Suspend & Power Button -> Automatic suspend = Off`

   * `Settings -> Provacy -> Screen Lock = Off`


   If the above settings do not work on your system, you may also need
   to install and run
   [Caffeine](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/caffeine.1.html):

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install caffeine
   sudo apt install caffeinate
   sudo apt install caffeine-indicator
   ```

   Then, make sure that Caffeine is activated:  Click on the coffee cup
   icon in the top Ubuntu bar and make sure it is *activated*.  Each
   time you restart the computer or switch users, make sure that you
   still have Caffeine activated.

    ![](/images/system_caffeine.png)

   *NOTE: Once you're sure that the machine blank or put the display to
   sleep, you can probably shut off the monitor using its physical
   switch when you aren't using it.*



4. The `untrusted` user for autograding needs access to the X Server /
   X Window System.  You can do this for the current user and current
   session by typing:

   ```
   xhost +SI:localuser:untrusted00
   ```

   Note: It is necessary that this command be run every time the
   computer is rebooted, for whichever user is logged in.  It might be
   easiest to automate this by editing the `/etc/profile` file (as
   root) and adding these lines at the bottom:

   ```
   # SUBMITTY AUTOGRADING OF GRAPHICAL PROGRAMS
   # ALLOW REMOTE LAUNCH OF X WINDOWS
   if [ "$DISPLAY" != "" ]
   then
     xhost +SI:localuser:untrusted00
   fi
   ```

5. Determine the value of the DISPLAY environment variable on the
   graphics worker machine.  From a interactive terminal on that
   machine (not a remote login), type:

   ```
   echo $DISPLAY
   ```

   which should print `:0` or `:1` for example.  Note: The value will
   depend on the number of graphics cards and outputs of those cards
   and it *may* change if the system hardware or drivers or physical
   connections are modified.


6. Test that you can remotely launch a graphical program on the worker
   machine from another computer.  From a terminal on another
   computer, connect via ssh to the worker machine.   Type:

   ```
   export DISPLAY=:0
   ```

   _Replacing `:0` with the value found in the previous step as necessary._

   Then run a command in the remote terminal that will open a
   graphical window on the worker machine.


7. Now enter the value of the DISPLAY environment variable in the
   `autograding_workers.json` file on the primary Submitty machine:

   ```
    "graphicsworker": {
        "capabilities": [
            "graphics", "default"
        ],
        "address": "graphicsworker.myuniversity.edu",
        "username": "submitty",
        "num_autograding_workers": 1,
        "enabled": true,
        "display_environment_variable" : ":0"
    }
    ```

   _Again, replacing `:0` with the value found in the earlier step._


8. Finally, test the autograding of a graphical program.  It is
   useful for debugging to watch the monitor and confirm that the
   graphical program window is successfully opened, and the mouse and
   key actions are performed as scripted.
