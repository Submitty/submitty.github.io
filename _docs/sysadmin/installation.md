These instructions will help guide you to installing Submitty onto a
server (whether on a dedicated machine or a VM).

**Note**: We assume that you're installing Submitty on a dedicated machine. If this machine is
used for other things, you may need to adapt the instructions below and
[install_system.sh](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/install_system.sh)
for your needs (as the script installs all of the dependencies that Submitty depends on).

**Note:** Part of the installation process consists of changing the default umask
for users from 002 to 027 to better protect the files that Submitty generates
during operation as well as any instructors who are SSHing into the machine and
so as to not potentially allow other access to confidential material. This does
mean that installing certain things (like python packages through pip) into a
global scope will need to have their permissions updated or else only the owner
will be able to read/execute it.

_Note: These instructions should be run under root/sudo._


1. [Install Ubuntu 18.04 server edition (or other supported distro)](server_os)


2. Run the bootstrap script:
   ```
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Submitty/Submitty/master/.setup/bootstrap.sh | bash
   ```
   
   or clone the git repository and run the installer (requires git and lsb-release to be installed):

   ```
   mkdir -p /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT
   git clone https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty.git /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty
   cd /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty
   bash ./.setup/install_system.sh
   ```

   Note: During installation, you will be asked several questions by the
   [CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/CONFIGURE_SUBMITTY.py)
   script. These questions are:
   1. Database Host
   2. Submitty Database User/Role
   3. Submitty Database User/Role Password
   4. Timezone
   5. Main Site URL
   6. Version Control System (VCS) URL
   7. Institution Name
   8. Authentication Method (PAM or Database)

   If you already have your database server installed and set up, you
   will most likely just specify `localhost` for the Database Host.
   Note: The database user is not a Linux user, just a user/role
   within the database server.  If you don't already have a role for
   the submitty database user/role, the script will create that for
   you with the specified name & password.


4. Run installations specific to your university.  
   For example:  [RPI Computer Science specific installations](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/distro_setup/ubuntu/rpi.sh)

   ```
   sudo bash /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty/.setup/distro_setup/ubuntu/rpi.sh
   ```


4. Edit PHP Settings

   We recommend for security that you modify your PHP installation and disable certain PHP functions.
   To do this, edit `/etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini`  and find the entry for `disable_functions` and prepend the list of
   disabled functions with:

   ```
   popen,pclose,proc_open,chmod,php_real_logo_guid,php_egg_logo_guid,php_ini_scanned_files,php_ini_loaded_file,readlink,symlink,link,set_file_buffer,proc_close,proc_terminate,proc_get_status,proc_nice,getmyuid,getmygid,getmyinode,putenv,get_current_user,magic_quotes_runtime,set_magic_quotes_runtime,import_request_variables,ini_alter,stream_socket_client,stream_socket_server,stream_socket_accept,stream_socket_pair,stream_get_transports,stream_wrapper_restore,mb_send_mail,openlog,syslog,closelog,pfsockopen,posix_kill,apache_child_terminate,apache_get_modules,apache_get_version,apache_lookup_uri,apache_reset_timeout,apache_response_headers,virtual,system,phpinfo,exec,shell_exec,passthru,
   ```

   _Note: Ubuntu 18.04 is using 7.2, but older versions might be using `php7.0-fpm`._

5. Setup Apache

   Note: If you don't have a SSL certificate for your server, we recommend
   using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get one. It's recommended
   that you use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to do this (and to have
   an HTTP configuration up).

   We provide a default apache configuration at
   [.setup/apache/submitty.conf](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/apache/submitty.conf)
   which you can just copy to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`. You will
   need to replace all instances of `__your_domain__` with your actual
   domain (don't include the `https://` part of it) and
   `/path/to/ssl/certificate/` to the actual path for your SSL certificate.

   Note: If you used Let's Encrypt, your certificates will be at
   `/etc/letsencrypt/live/__your_domain__`, otherwise the common place to
   look would be `/etc/apache2/ssl`.

   The basic commands to do this are:
   ```
   cp /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT/Submitty/.setup/apache/submitty.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/submitty.conf
   a2ensite submitty
   ```

   We also recommend that you Edit `/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/security.conf` to ensure
   these options below are set to limit the information the server
   gives to potential hackers:

   ```
   ServerTokens Prod
   ServerSignature Off
   ```

   You probably want to first disable or remove the default
   configurations to prevent unintended access to the web server (but
   donâ€™t do this if the default site is already in use).

   ```
   a2dissite 000-default
   ```

   You may also want to comment out the directory specific portions of
   ``` /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ``` so that you do not risk
   configuration conflicts with your other configurations.  (Things
   that begin with Directory and end with /Directory).

   Alternately, we provide
   [submitty_http.conf](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/apache/submitty_http.conf)
   to run Submitty on just HTTP.  We recommend only using this if you are
   planning on developing for Submitty.  For production, we strongly recommend
   that you get a certificate and use HTTPS/SSL.

6. We recommend that you should leave the PostgreSQL setup unless you know what
   you're doing.  However, for the version of PostgreSQL that comes with Ubuntu
   Server, you _may_ use UNIX sockets and disable the ability to connect to the
   DB via TCP. The socket improves query responses minorly while disabling TCP
   can better secure your DB if you don't plan to connect to it via localhost,
   IP, etc. The socket by default is run at `/var/run/postgresql`. To disable
   TCP, you will need to edit `/etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf` and
   disable all the lines that start with `host` and `hostssl`. You will also
   have to modify `/usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh` and change
   `DATABASE_HOST` to point to the socket, and then re-run the script.

   NOTES:
   - When using Ubuntu 18.04, the configuration file path to disable TCP is
     `/etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf`.
   - If you intend to run the [Student Auto Feed](student_auto_feed), do not
     disable TCP.

7. Test apache config with:  `apache2ctl -t`

   If everything looks ok, restart apache with:  `service apache2 restart'


### Troubleshooting
- **I cannot connect to PAM!**
  1. Submitty authenticates PAM through the python module
     [python-pam](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pam/) using the
     `submitty_cgi` user. By default, we assume you're going to use local accounts
     for authentication and as such `submitty_cgi` has been added to the `shadow`
     group so that it can read /etc/password which is necessary for PAM to work.

     To test PAM, you can do:

     ```bash
     $ sudo su submitty_cgi -c python3
     Python 3.5.1 (default, Jun 29 2016, 13:08:31)
     [GCC 4.9.2] on linux2
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>> import pam
     >>> p = pam.pam()
     >>> p.authenticate('username', 'password')
     True
     ```

     (where `username` and `password` match some account on the machine).

     If you get an error about module pam not being found, that means that
     `submitty_cgi` does not have the proper permissions to the module and if
     you get False on authentication, then `submitty_cgi` does not have the
     proper permissions to check the right files via PAM.

  2. If the PAM module is functioning, but Submitty is still erroring during
     user authentication, check `/var/log/apache2/submitty.log` for these
     entries with a recent timestamp:

     1. `AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /usr/local/submitty/site/cgi-bin/pam_check.cgi`
     2. `POST /cgi-bin/pam_check.cgi HTTP/1.1" 403 470 "-" "-"`

     This indicates that apache is blocking the execution of Submitty's
     authentication code.  Try adding this line to `submitty.conf` under the
     heading `<Directory "/usr/local/submitty/site/cgi-bin">`.

     - `Require all granted`

- **Installation Fails During NTP Setup**
  1.  This is indicative that you installed the Ubuntu 18.04 "Live" server.
      "Live" server is unsupported.  Please install the traditional server.
      Please see the [Server OS](server_os) page for more details.
