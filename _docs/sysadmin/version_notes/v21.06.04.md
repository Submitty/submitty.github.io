title:  v21.06.04 -- External Secondary Email Addresses
---


Release [v21.06.04](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v21.06.04)
adds the option for storing a secondary contact email address for every user.

Since there will likely be a different rate limit for sending email to
internal/university addresses vs external/non-university addresses, we
must add a new configuration option to the
`/usr/local/submitty/config/email.json` file.

Edit this file and add the following field to the file:

```
"email_internal_domain": "myuniversity.edu"
```

Notifications to email addresses that match the specified pattern will
be prioritized and sent at a maximum rate of 100 per minute.
Notifications to all other email addresses will be sent at a maximum
rate of 500 per hour.  These rates can be modified by editing the
[`send_email.py`](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/sbin/send_email.py)
script.
