title:  v19.08.03 -- Static Maintenance Page
category: System Administrator
---

Beginning with version
[v19.08.03](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v19.08.03)
of the main Submitty repository we will direct all traffic to a simple
static maintenance page during the 1-2 minutes when we are executing
the steps of installation that update the website files and resources.
This will prevent the user receiving lengthy and confusing error
messages caused by temporarily missing resources.

In order for this change to work on an existing production
installation you must manually modify your Apache configuration:



Edit your Apache configuration:

1. Go to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`

2. Find the appropriate `.conf` file.

   _Note: If you have multiple files, you can double check which
   configurations are linked (and thus in-use) from the
   `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory._

3. Make the two modifications below:


   * Move `index.html` to the front of the list:

       old code:
       ``` 
       DirectoryIndex index.php index.cgi index.html
       ```

       new code:
       ```
       DirectoryIndex index.html index.php index.cgi
       ```

    * Add a rule to serve index.html

       Immediately after this block:
       ```
       # If the requested filename exists, simply serve it.
       RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
       RewriteRule ^ - [L]
       ```

       Add this new code:
       ```
       # Else if index.html exists on the local filesystem because we are
       # updating Submitty, we serve the index.html so that users do not
       # get served with strange PHP errors and such.
       RewriteCond /usr/local/submitty/site/public/index.html -f
       RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
       ```

   * _Note: You can compare your entire Apache configuration with the
     [Submitty provided sample submitty.conf](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/blob/master/.setup/apache/submitty.conf)_


4.  Restart Apache

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
    ```


5.  Now when you update your Submitty software on your
    machine to v19.08.03 or later, e.g.:

    ```
    sudo /usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh
    ```

    During the 1-2 minutes of installation if you load any page on the
    website you will see a simple maintenance page with this message:
