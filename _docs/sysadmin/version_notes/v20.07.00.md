title:  v20.07.00 -- Additional WebSockets Support
---

To support the expanded use of Websockets for additional dynamic pages
within the Submitty website, we must remove a restriction on a
specific php function.

Version
[v20.07.00](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v20.07.00)
requires the following edits:

1. Locate your `php.ini` file.  
   _It is probably something like `/etc/php/7.2/fpm/php.ini`._


2. Edit this file:  
   Remove `stream_socket_client` from the list of `disabled_functions`.  
   Save the file.


3. Restart php fpm:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart php7.2-fpm
   ```
