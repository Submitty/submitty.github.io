title: v19.07.01 -- Autograding Randomized Input/Output
category: System Administrator
---

**** NOTE: DRAFT -- [PR #3882 NOT MERGED YET](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pull/3882)****

For this release we need to re-build all autograding configurations
for all gradeables for all courses.  Please do this after running
`INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh`.

```
sudo su

/usr/local/submitty/.setup/INSTALL_SUBMITTY.sh

for s in /var/local/submitty/courses/*/*; do c=`basename $s`; ${s}/BUILD_${c}.sh; done
```
