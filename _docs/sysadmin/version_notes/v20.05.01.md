title:  v20.05.01 -- WebSockets
---

Beginning with version
[v20.05.01](https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/releases/v20.05.01)
of the main Submitty repository, we have added a new WebSocket
interface. This is to be used for making certain high-traffic pages,
like the simple grading interface, more dynamic and allow people
to see new content without having to refresh their page. To enable this
feature, you will need to add the following lines to your apache
site configuration file for Submitty:

1. Go to `/etc/apache2/sites-available`

2. Find the appropriate `.conf` file.

   _Note: If you have multiple files, you can double check which
   configurations are linked (and thus in-use) from the
   `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory._

3. Make the modification below somewhere in the file under the
top-level VirtualHost directive:

    ```text
        ProxyRequests Off
        ProxyPass "/ws/"  "ws://127.0.0.1:41983/"
    ```

4. Restart apache: `systemctl restart apache2`
