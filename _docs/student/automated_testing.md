title: Examing the Results of Automated Testing
---

The webpage displays a summary of the results on the test cases
configured by your instructor.  If the test case is configured to
award automated grading points, a green, yellow, red, or gray token
appears next to each test.  Green means full credit, yellow is partial
credit, red is low or no credit.  The gray token appears if the test
is extra credit or hidden.

If more details are available for a specific test case, a "Details"
link will appear on the right side.  You may click on this link or on
the title of the test case to toggle expansion of these details.
_NOTE: Additional details are intentionally not available for hidden
test cases._

If the test case was graded by line-by-line or character-by-character
comparison to the instructors expected output, these files will be
displayed and differences highlighted in yellow and/or red.

Additional output to STDOUT, STDERR, or specific error messages may be
displayed, depending on the instructor configuration of each test
case.
