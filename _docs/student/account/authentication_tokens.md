## Creating a new Authentication Token

To create a git auth token navigate to the Git Auth Tokens
page using the link on the left menu bar. Once you generate a token,
make sure to write it down or save it within your Git client as you
won't be able to see it again.  If you forget or lose your token you
can always revoke old ones and recreate a new token.

## Managing Authentication Tokens

   To review and manage what Authentication Tokens are stored on your
   system, open the **Keychain Access** application from Launchpad.
