The initial navigation page displays all available assignments
organized in reverse chronological order of deadline into several
categories:

  * "Open" - accepting submissions for a homework deadline that is in the
     future.  

  * "Past Due" - depending on the course rules for late work or
    extensions for special circumstances, submission may still be
    allowed for these assignments.

  * "Closed" - the TAs are currently reviewing these assignments and
    completing the non-automated portion of grading.

  * "Grades Available" - TA grading is complete and available for
    review for these assignments.
