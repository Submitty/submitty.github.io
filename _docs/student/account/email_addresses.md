## Primary Email Address

When your Submitty account is created, your primary email address will
be specified by your instructor or system administrator.  This will
typically be your university / school email address.

You can view this email on your "My Profile" page.  However, you cannot
directly edit this email address.  If there is an error with this
address, contact your instructor or system administrator.

If [email notifications](notifications) are
[configured on your system](/sysadmin/email_configuration), those
notifications will be sent to your primary email
address.


## Secondary Email Address

You may *optionally* specify a secondary email address that will be
made available to your instructors.  Furthermore, you can specify that
email notifications are sent to your secondary email address in
addition to your primary address.
