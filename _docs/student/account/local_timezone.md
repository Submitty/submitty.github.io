When students, teaching assistants, and instructors are not in a
common physical location, it is helpful for each to specify their
*local timezone*.  This information can help with timely
communications and with planning the office hour and exam schedule.

*Note:* Currently, all dates are specified based on the timezone of
the server (generally the institution's physical location).  Coming
soon...  Submitty will adjust the display due date for assignments
based on the user's specified local timezone.

Select the closest, most appropriate location from the
[List of Available Timezones](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_timezones.asp).
