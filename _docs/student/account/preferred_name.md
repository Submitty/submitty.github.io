Your preferred name will be used on all webpages within Submitty: when
you participate in the online discussion forum, when you form teams
with your classmates, and when your TA or instructor grades your
assignments.  Your registration name will only be visible to your
instructors and only appears on the final grade sheet, next to your
preferred name, to ensure that your grade can be correctly entered to
your school's registration system.
