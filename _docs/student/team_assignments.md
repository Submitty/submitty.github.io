### What are Team Assignments?

![](/images/team_navigation.png)

Your instructor will either assign you and your classmates to teams or
you will be asked to form a team with your classmates on your own.
Consult the course syllabus and specific assignment instructions for
information regarding minimum or maximum team size, etc.  Once your
team is formed, any member of the team can submit for the team.  Team
submission and review of autograding & TA grading results is similar
to individual submission.


Only one team member needs to upload the final submission for the team.
As you're working one or more team members may submit different versions of the assignment,
and by default, only the most recent submission will be graded by the
TA/instructor and count towards your final semester grade.
The team shares a submission version and timestamp history --
see also [Managing Versions / Multiple Submissions](managing_versions).

All members of the team can review the submission files, the
autograding results, and the TA/instructor grade.  Everyone on the
team will receive the same grade.  Note that if [late days](late_days) are allowed
for the assignment and the team submits 1 day late, every member of
the team will be charged one late day.



### Creating a Team

After clicking on the manage team page, you will be given the option
to create a new team or to seek a team or partner.

If you select ```Create New Team```, you will be shown the team
management portal. Here you can invite more students and see who is on
your team.

Once you are on a team, you can view your teammates and their email
addresses through the “Manage Team” portal.

### Seek Team/Partner

When you click on the ```Seek Team/Partner``` button, your name, user
ID, and email address will be shown to all other students in the
course.  This will enable other students/teams to contact you and
invite you to join their team.

### Joining a Team

If you receive an invite to join a team, the user ID of the student
who sent the invite will be displayed.  All you have to do is click
"Accept" to join the team.

### Locked Teams

Your instructor can specify a date after which the membership of all
teams is locked. The manage team button will then change to a view
team button. Once that happens, you will be unable to change your
team.

If you forgot to create your team or invite all team members to your team before the team lock date, you
may only accept invitations to existing teams sent before the lock date or
form a "team of one" that contains only yourself.  Consult the course
syllabus and/or specific assignment instructions regarding penalties
and procedures for team membership management after the team lock
date.
