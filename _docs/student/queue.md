### Overview of the Queue
A new way to organize, assist, and empower students to get the help they need.

### What is the Queue

The queue available on submitty allows each class to maintain
multiple queues per class. This makes it easier for students
to get help from a member of the teaching staff without having
to move to the board and write your name on a central board or 
draw attention to yourself.

### Who does the Queue help
The queue is meant to be used by anyone. However, this feature
is particularly helpful for physically handicapped students who
may find moving to write their name on the board a difficult task.
In addition students with social anxieties may be less likely to 
want to draw attention to themself but the queue allows them to get
help without the extra attention that comes from raising your hand.

### Joining the Queue

Students can join the queue by going to the queue section from the left side
and entering their name, selecting a queue name from the drop down list, and
entering the code for that queue. If you are unsure which queue you want to join
or the code for that queue ask your instructor running that queue.

### Waiting in the Queue

Once in the queue, you will be able to see how many people are ahead of you in 
line as well as which queue you are currently waiting in. In order to get the most
benifit out of the features of the queue including queue history and instructor tools
be sure to give the instructor a chance to remove you from the queue properly. However,
if they forget you can use the red button to remove yourself from the queue.

### Protecting Privacy with the Queue
When students join the queue they may not be comfortable using their real name
and have the option of entering something different. However, if students abuse this
privilage instructors have the ability to view the students username used for login.

### Queue History
The queue history shows that the backlog of each student when they were helped that day. 
By default the history only shows the most recent activity but the enitre backlog is available 
to view. The history keeps track of when the student was helped, how long they waited and
which instructor helped them.
