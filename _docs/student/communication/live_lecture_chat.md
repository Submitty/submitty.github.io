Live lecture chat is a feature which allows Submitty users to engage in real time communication via their course page. Its primary use case is to allow for live participation within lectures, creating a similar ease of communication to an online lecture.

## Live Lecture Chat Usage

Once your instructor has enabled Live Lecture Chat, it will appear on the sidebar for student use:

Upon clicking on Live Lecture Chat, you will be met with this menu:

When an instructor enables live chat, a chat entry will appear. Your instructor may have enabled the ability to join Anonymously as shown below:

You can now enter Live Lecture Chat. There you will see messages from other Submitty users in your course:
