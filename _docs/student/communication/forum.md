The discussion forum on Submitty is an open area for instructors to
post announcements, and for students and members of the teaching staff
to discuss course policies and course material. The discussion forum
allows anyone to ask questions and provide answers.

*IMPORTANT: Be sure to review your instructor's course syllabus to
confirm what questions and what materials are appropriate for
discussing and sharing with your classmates on the Discussion Forum.*


## Why Use the Discussion Forum?

* **Quick Assistance**  
  Students may find that asking for help on the discussion forum
  results in more prompt replies than in person, especially outside of
  formal class and office hours times.

* **Help the Entire Class**  
  Remember that if you have a question, you are probably not the only
  one. Using the forum to ask for clarification on the upcoming
  assignment can reduce repeat questions and even shorten wait times
  during in person office hours.

* **Anonymity**  
  Students may check the box to post their message to the forum
  anonymously to other students in the class.  Note that the teaching
  staff will be able to access your name -- which is useful, for
  example, if your question is about a confusing autograding test case
  error message.

* **Image Attachments**  
  Posts on the Discussion Forum can include .png or .jpeg image
  attachments.


## At a Glance
   
* **New/Unread Posts**  
   When a thread contains posts with a post or edit date after the last
   view by the current user, the entire thread or specific posts
   within a thread will be highlighted with a different color background.

   In [Light Mode](/student/account/theme) new/unread posts will have
   a light blue background.  When a thread has been viewed, all
   current posts will be tagged as seen or read by the current user
   and the background will switch to white.

   In [Dark or Black Theme](/student/account/theme) new/unread posts
   will be light gray (stand out from the background color) and viewed posts
   will gray or black respectively (match the background color).

* **Teaching Staff Posts**  
   Posts by a member of the teaching staff (instructor or grader)
   will be rendered with a bright yellow border.

* **Unresolved Thread / Unanswered Question** ![](/images/discussion_forum_icons/df_question_mark.png){:width="40px"}  
   Threads labeled with a large yellow question mark contain a question
   from a student and it has not yet been *resolved*.  All members of
   the course (students *and* teaching staff) are encouraged to read the
   question and thread share information.  The state of the thread
   (unresolved/resolved) can be edited by either the original poster or a
   member of the teaching staff.

* **Resolved Thread / Answered Question** ![](/images/discussion_forum_icons/df_checkmark.png){:width="40px"}  
   Threads labeled with a large green check mark contain a question from
   a student that has been resolved.

* **Pinned Announcements** FIXME   ![](/images/discussion_forum_icons/df_thumbtack.png){:width="40px"}  
   Announcement posts/threads from a member of the teaching staff will be labeled
   with a large yellow thumbtack.  These threads will appear at the top of the
   sorted ordering for *all* users.

* **Personal Bookmarks** FIXME  ![](/images/discussion_forum_icons/df_bookmark.png){:width="40px"}  
   Each user can label specific threads with personal bookmarks so they
   are easy to find in the future.  Similar to global pinning of
   announcements, these threads will be sorted to the top of the
   thread list (just below pinned annoumcements).

* **Locked Conversations** ![](/images/discussion_forum_icons/df_lock.png){:width="40px"}  
   The lock symbol will appear when a thread has been *locked* by a member of the
   teaching staff.  Students cannot add additional posts and existing posts
   within the thread may not be edited.

* **Additional Data**
   Each post contain details about the author, date and time of creation.
