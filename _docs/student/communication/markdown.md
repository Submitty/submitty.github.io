    teletype / fixed-width type.  This is useful for short, inlined code.


*  **Code Blocks**  
   Adding ```` ``` ```` (a triple backtick) on blank lines above and below
   text will turn it into a code block.  For example:

   ````
   ```
   int main() {
       printf("hello world\n");
   }
   ```
   ````

*  **Lists**  
   Adding `*` or numbers (ex. `1.`, `2.`, `3.`) followed by a space before text

   ``` 
   * Item 1
   * Item 2
   
   1. Item 1
   2. Item 2
   3. Item 3
   ```
