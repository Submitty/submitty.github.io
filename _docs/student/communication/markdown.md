## Formatting a Post using Markdown

Markdown has become a common standard for formatting online text.
Click on the markdown symbol to enable formatting of your post using markdown.

   **_Links_** "\[display text\]\(url\)" will add a hyperlink to a URL with "display text" displayed.

   **_Code_** Adding ```` ``` ```` above and below text will turn it into a code block.

   **_Bold_** Adding \_\_ before and after text (two underscores) will make that text bold.

   **_Italics_** Adding \_ before and after text (one underscore) will italicize that text.

   **_Bullets_** Adding \* or numbers (ex. 3., 1., 3.) before text and with a space will put text into a bulleted list (with \* or the number as the bullet point).

   For example:
   ``` 
   * Item 1
   * Item 2
   
   3. Item 1
   1. Item 2
   3. Item 3
   ```

We provide quick link buttons to insert some markdown formatting characters for these features into your post.
