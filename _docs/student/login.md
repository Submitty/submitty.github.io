What is the Homework Submission Server URL for your course?  (Your
instructor should provide this information.)  Load this URL in your
favorite web browser.

Have your login credentials ready.  (Again, your instructor should
provide this information.)  If you have trouble
authenticating/accessing the page, double check the URL and your
username and password, and contact the instructor, TA, or system
administrator as appropriate.

After you login, another page appears with your course and personal information on it.

## What Can I Do Here?

This page is your gateway to the rest of Submitty. From here, you can enter
your current courses and past courses if your professor archived them. You can also view your student
information, change your name if your preferred name does not match school records, and if available
at your school, change your password.

## How Can I Access My Courses?

In the left box, there is a stack of buttons with each course you are enrolled in, one on each button. The
semester you took the course in is towards the left of the button and the name of the course is beside it.
Decide which course  to enter and click the button, which will take you to that course's homepage. From
there you can access assignments, submit homeworks, grades, and more.

## How Can I Change My Name?

If you need to change your name, click on the pencil to the right of your name in the right-hand side box.
A form will pop up with a place to change your first and last names. Edit your preferred first and/or
last name, then click "Submit". To exit the form without saving your entry, click "Close".

## How Can I Change My Password?

If your system uses database passwords specific to this server, you can change your password. Under
your email in the "About You" right box, if the option is available to you, it will say "Change Password".

To do so, click the pencil to the right of "Change Password" and a form will pop up. Fill in your current
password in the top box on the form and your new password in the bottom box, then click the "Submit" button.
If you want to exit the form without saving the changes, simply click the "Close" button.
