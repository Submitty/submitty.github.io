also by email, if

Users can configure their subscription to notifications and email from
the "Notification Settings" page on the left sidebar.

On this page you will see settings for both notifications, notificaitons that are shown on Submitty, and emails, notifications sent by email. Emails must be [enabled](../sysadmin/email_configuration) for email settings to be shown. The types of notifications are separated by features of Submitty.
