## Formatting a Post using Markdown

Markdown has become a common standard for formatting online text.
Click on the markdown symbol to enable formatting of your post using markdown.

The most useful features of markdown for the Submitty Discussion Forum
are the code blocks (fixed width font) and external url links.  We provide
quick link buttons to insert the markdown formatting characters for
these features into your post.

The discussion forum does not support image markdown (`![alt](linkToImage)`). Markdown syntax for images will be converted to a hyperlink.
