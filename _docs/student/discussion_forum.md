## What is the Discussion Forum

The discussion forum on submitty is an open area for students and members of the teaching staff to start discussions and answer questions. The discussion forum allows anyone to ask questions and provide answers.

_Warning: Be sure to confirm with your instructor what kind of content is allowed_

## Why use the Discussion Forum

**_Quick Assistance_** Many people find that asking questions on the discussion forum results in faster help than help waiting to ask in person.

**_Helps the entire class_** Remember that if you have a question, you are probably not the only one. Asking and answering questions here can reduce repeat question and even shorten wait times during office hours.

**_Anonymous_** Students are allowed to post anonymously to other students in the class.

**Attachments** Submitty allows for posts to contain attached files.

## Formatting a Post using Markdown

Markdown has become a common standard for formatting online text.
Click on the markdown symbol to enable formatting of your post using markdown.

The most useful features of markdown for the Submitty Discussion Forum
are the code blocks (fixed width font) and external url links.  We provide
quick link buttons to insert the markdown formatting characters for
these features into your post.

The discussion forum does not support image markdown (`![alt](linkToImage)`). Markdown syntax for images will be converted to a hyperlink.
