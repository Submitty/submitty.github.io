title: Submission Version Conflict
---



Once TA grading has begun, students *should not make new submissions nor should they
[change the active version](/student/submission/managing_versions) of their submission*.
If they do one of these actions, this will be flagged in the Submitty
grading system as a *version conflict*.

This inconsistency is a problem.  Submitty will not combine the
autograding score of the currently selected version with the manual
grading score awarded by the grader to the previously selected
version.  Also, Submitty uses the currently selected version to
compute the number of late days used in this assignment.

The comments and points awarded by the grader apply only to the
version that was active at the time of grading.  If there is a
mismatch the grading feedback to the student will be highlighted in
red as shown above.  The student's score for the entire assignment will
be a zero until this mismatch or conflict is resolved.


## How to Resolve a Version Conflict

If you have accidentally made an extra submission to this assignment,
you should use the drop down menu to
[revert to the submission](/student/submission/managing_versions#reverting-to-an-earlier-submission)
to the version that was active when manual grading began.
 
Alternatively, if your instructor has given permission for you to make
this late submission, then confirm that your desired version is
selected for grading, and then contact your instructor / grader and
ask them to update the grading as necessary.
