title: Resolving a Version Conflict
---

## Overview of Issue

When you choose to grade another version after the TA's have began/finished grading, there is a high likelihood that the version they graded is not the version that you recently submitted. This causes a Version Conflict that has to be either solved by you or the TA grading your assignment.


## Steps to Take to Resolve a Version Conflict

If the Instructor species that Version Conflicts will happen, then you can ignore the next steps. 

Check the Version numbers for each rubric component.

If they are all the same number, then you can change your active version to that version. Check out [Managing Versions](/student/submission/managing_versions) to change submission version.

If they are different numbers, contact an Instructor/TA to regrade the assignment if possible to get a valid grade.
